Simulation Parameters
EnergyPlus includes a group of input objects used to set general parameters related to how the
simulation is performed. Some of these input objects are controlling different options that are
allowed within EnergyPlus such as the selection of algorithms to use or parameters related to how
an algorithm is used. For a new modeler, these input objects should be included with their default
field values. Later when additional control is necessary to model a specific type of measure, the
field values can be re-evaluated. The following input object allows you to control how you want the
simulation to be performed. The input objects should appear in your file and appear in almost all
of the example files:

• SimulationControl - controls if the simulation is run for the weather file period and if sizing
calculations are performed. You should become familiar with this input object since you may
find it one that you frequently change during the Run-Check-Edit cycle.
Two other input objects should appear in your input file and are included in almost all example
files:

• Version - indicates what version of EnergyPlus is being used.

• Building - includes fields for the name of the building, and the angle of the entire building
compared to true north, as well as parameters related to the simulation that, in general,
should be allowed to default.

For a new modeler, the following input objects may be omitted. They can be added later for special
cases althought they and appear in almost all of the example files:
• Timestep - the number of timesteps each hour and usually set to 6.

• HeatBalanceAlgorithm - selects the algorithm used for simulating heat and moisture transfer
through the surfaces of the building and usually set to ConductionTransferFunction.
3132 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS

• SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Inside - selects the algorithm used for the inside face of the
building surfaces and is usually set to TARP.

• SurfaceConvectionAlgorithm:Outside - selects the algorithm used for the outside face of the
building surfaces between interior and exterior conditions and is usually set to DOE-2.
These input objects and more are further explained in the InputOutputReference under the heading
“Group-Simulation Parameters.”

4.2 Location and Climate
Many of the fields in the group of input objects related to location, climate, and the weather file
are ones that will be set once for each specific project.

• Site:Location - describes the name, latitude, longitude and other parameters related to the
location of the building. When using a weather file, the values from the weather file will be
used instead. Predefined location objects may be found in the DDY file that accompanies
most epw weather files.

• SizingPeriod:DesignDay - the high and low temperature and humidities describing a design
day that is used for sizing equipment. Two (or more) instances of this input object are
frequently in a file, one for heating and one for cooling. The DDY file that comes with the
weather file should include input objects that may be used here.

• RunPeriod - the start and stop dates of the simulation and often set to the full year. When
debugging a file, a shorter period of time can be used to speed up the simulation portion of
the Run-Check-Edit cycle.


• RunPeriodControl:SpecialDays - allows specfication of holidays and a good example can be
seen in 5ZoneCostEst.idf.

• RunPeriodControl:DaylightSavingTime - allows the specification of the start and ending
period for daylight savings time. This will impact when schedules operate but please note
that output reporting timesteps are always shown in standard time so schedules will shift
an hour in the output when daylight savings time is active. A good example can be seen in
5ZoneCostEst.idf.

• Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface - for one of the ground temperature algorithms,
specifies the average temperature for each month of the year. This temperature is applied
directly to the outside face of surfaces which use the "Ground" outside boundary conditions.
See "Ground Heat Transfer in EnergyPlus" in the Auxiliary Programs document for
information about preprocessors. There are also other more integrated ground heat transfer
options, see Site:GroundDomain:* and Foundation:Kiva.


• Site:WaterMainsTemperature - input for the water temperatures supplied to the building
from underground water mains and should be specified whenever water heaters are described.
A good example can be seen in 5ZoneVAV-ChilledWaterStorage-Mixed.idf. If not specified,
some default assumptions are used for the water temperature supplied to the building.4.3. SCHEDULES 33
Other input objects in this group can help perform sizing using the weather file, override
the sky temperature, impact the variation of outdoor conditions with building height (especially
important for tall buildings), work with ground temperatures and ground heat transfer, override the
precipitation in weather files, specify the irrigation for a green roof, and some advanced properties
related to the light spectrum for window performance. These input objects and more are further
explained in the InputOutputReference under the heading “Group-Location and Climate.”

4.3 Schedules
Many aspects of building operation are characterized by timing whether it is the hours that a
building is occupied or when the control systems are in various modes. Due to this, specifying
when something occurs using the Schedule input objects becomes one of the most common things
to do. It is important to coordinate schedules properly. The operation of offce equipment in a
space usually corresponds to occupancy of that space as does the thermostat set points and fan
operation. Because schedules are such a key input for so many features of a building, a great deal
of flexibility exists in EnergyPlus to specify them.

• Schedule:Compact - The most commonly used method of specifying schedules and uses
“Through” and “For” to reduce the amount of input required.

• ScheduleTypeLimits - Every schedule input object includes a field that helps validate the
limiting values for the schedule, and this input object describes the upper and lower limit.

• Schedule:Constant - If the value of the schedule is the same every hour of the year, this input
object is the easiest way to specify that value.

• Schedule:File - At times, data is available from a building being monitored or for factors that
change throughout the year. This input object allows a column of data from an external file
to be referenced as the values of the schedule. A variation of this input object allows input
specifically for shading.
Other input objects in this input group allow specification of schedule values to be in different
formats. These input objects and more are further explained in the InputOutputReference under
the heading “Group-Schedules.”

4.4 Surface Construction Elements
Specifying the physical properties of the building envelope is something every building model
includes. The input objects in this group allow the specification of the different layers that make up
exterior and interior walls, roofs, floors, windows, and skylights as well as the order of the materials
in these surfaces. A large number of input objects appear in this group since there are many special
features that need to be modeled for certain energy effciency measures. The following is a list of
only the most commonly used input objects.

• Material - the most common input object to describe the materials used in opaque
constructions in walls, roofs, and floors and includes inputs for the thickness, conductivity,
density, and specific heat as well as absorptances. See examples in ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf
located in the DataSets folder.34 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
Figure 4.1: Various Offce Schedules

• Material:NoMass - used when the material only has thermal resistance and little thermal
mass such as insulation. It should not be used to describe materials that do have significant
thermal mass.

• Material:AirGap - used to describe when walls or roofs have an air gap. Note, this is modeled
as a fixed resistance (with no internal convection or radiant transfer), and it cannot be used
for windows.

• WindowMaterial:Glazing - describes the material used in the glass (or other transparent
material) portion of the fenestration (windows and skylights). See WindowGlassMaterials.idf
in the DataSets folder for examples.

• WindowMaterial:Gas - the type of gas used between layers of glass in windows and skylights
has a significant impact on the heat transfer performance. See WindowGasMaterials.idf in
the DataSets folder for examples.

• Construction - a list of materials (any from the list above plus others) in order from the outside
to the inside making up the wall, roof, floor, window or skylight. Every input file will have
several of these input objects. Examples of constructions for walls, roofs, and floors can be
found in ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf located in the DataSets folder while examples
for windows and skylights can be found in WindowConstructs.idf in the same folder.

• WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem - the best way to describe a window is with a
construction input object that references WindowMaterial:Glazing and WindowMaterial:Gas
input objects but if all you have is the U-Factor and Solar Heat Gain Coeffcient (SHGC)
they can be specified in this input object.

A large variety of input objects in this group are not as commonly used but are key to modeling
specific types of walls and windows so if what you are trying to model does not fall into the neat4.5. THERMAL ZONES AND SURFACES 35
Figure 4.2: Envelope Component Hierarchy
categories for the input objects described so far, there is still a good chance that EnergyPlus has
an input object that will work. These other input objects include ones for walls and roof that can
be used when modeling combined heat and moisture transfer, modeling materials which undergo a
phase change to store heat in the wall or when the material properties change with temperature,
when the material allows infrared radiation to flow through it, when modeling green (vegetated)
roofs, for simplified C- or F-factor modeling, or when the wall includes resistance or hydronic tubing
to provide heat. The other input objects to describe windows and skylights include input objects
that can be used to describe thermochromic and electrochromic glazing, mixtures of gases between
layers of glass, vacuum glazing, movable portions of the window assembly such as shades and
blinds and screens, alternative ways of specifying fenestration such as equivalent layers or refraction
extinction method or ASHWAT model or from a WINDOW program export/data file or specifying
wavelength-by-wavelength properties.
The input objects described in this section are further explained in the InputOutputReference
under the heading “Group-Surface Construction Elements.”
4.5 Thermal Zones and Surfaces
The physical aspects of the building such as the walls, roof, and windows, is one of the most
important and often challenging aspects of creating a building energy model. In EnergyPlus, the
surfaces define the geometry of each zone and thus for the entire building. For many, a graphical user
interface will be used to help define the geometric aspects of the building energy model, and many
of the input objects described in this section will be directly created by that interface program. It is
still important to understand some of the details for these input objects because it is likely that you
will be reviewing them as part of debugging error messages. EnergyPlus uses the three dimensional36 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
position of each corner of a surface to define the position and orientation of that surface so for a
typical rectangular wall that represents 12 numbers and for a typical building with hundreds of
surfaces that means thousands of numbers are used to define the geometry of a building so you can
see why using an interface is so common.
EnergyPlus uses a right-hand coordinate system as shown in Figure X with three dimensions.
The X-axis points east, the Y-axis points north, and the Z-axis points up.
Figure 4.3: EnergyPlus Coordinate System

• Zone - defines the name of the thermal zone as well as the ceiling height, floor area, and volume.
For most zones that are fully enclosed these three entries can be calculated automatically be
EnergyPlus and do not need to be entered. A zone multiplier allows a single zone to represent
many identical zones (such as all the enclosed offces on one side of a building). The name
of the zone will be referenced in many places in the input file so it should be clear what it is
describing. When defining a zone, it is important for the entire area to be thermally similar
both in heat being transferred through exterior walls as well as interior heat gains. But using
as few zones as possible (and thus as few surfaces) also can result in faster simulations, so
there is no reason to slow down the simulation just so two (or more) essentially identical areas
are each simulated. The coordinates can be just set to zero if the world coordinate system is
used (see GlobalGeometryRules below).

• BuildingSurface:Detailed - lists the three-dimensional coordinates that define each corner as
well as referencing the zone that the surface is attached to and the construction of the wall
(list of materials). This input object supports any shape surface with three or more corners
(vertices). In addition, this input object defines what is on the other side of the surface from
the zone, whether that is outside, another zone in the building, or the ground. Other inputs
indicate if the outside of the surface is exposed to the sun or the wind.4.5. THERMAL ZONES AND SURFACES 37

• FenestrationSurface:Detailed - describes windows, doors, and special daylighting tubes and
it references the wall that it is part of. It also requires the specification of vertices (usually
four but three is also allowed) to describe the corners of the window or door as well as the
construction which, in this case, is generally the layers of glass and the gas fill between the
layers. It has a field for a multiplier although usually the multiplier is set to one since
the position of windows matters to many of the algorithms used. In order to describe
the frame of the window and any dividers that it might have, a separate input object
(WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider) may be included and referenced. A good example file
is WindowsTests.idf. To understand how to model the many options for windows, a section
and a table in the Input Output Reference called “Window Modeling Options” should be
examined.

Shading Related
Casting shadows on the building, especially onto windows, can significantly impact the energy use
of a building, and EnergyPlus includes several input objects to model this effect. The largest impact
of shading surfaces is to reduce solar gain through windows that are shaded. There are two kinds
of shading surfaces in EnergyPlus, detached and attached. A detached shading surface, such as
a tree or neighboring building, is not connected to the building. An attached shading surface is
typically an overhang or fin that is attached to a particular base surface of the building, usually a
wall; attached shading surfaces are usually designed to shade specific windows.

• Shading:Site:Detailed - describes something near but not attached to the building that casts
a shadow on the building such as nearby buildings or mountains and includes the vertex of
one corner as well as the length and width. For deciduous trees, and other situations that
shading changes over time, the schedule for the transmittance can vary, otherwise, it should
always be set to zero or leave the schedule name blank.

• Shading:Zone:Detailed - describes an attachment to the building that casts a shadow such as
an overhang or fin. It also includes a reference to a transmittance schedule. The wall that
the fin or overhang is attached to is also specified.

If using relative coordinates (see GlobalGeometryRules), you may also want to use the
Shading:Building:Detailed input object since it will “rotate” with the building. Typically,
Shading:Site:Detailed is used for things that are fixed at the site and don’t move with building
rotation. Shading:Building:Detailed is for larger structures like a parking garage or canopy which
aren’t associated with a specific zone but would likely rotate with the building.
Input Object Variations
EnergyPlus includes a bunch of variations on these basic surface input objects that map to a closer
representation of real surfaces in buildings. These input objects are effectively just different ways
to represent the same information as the BuildingSurface:Detailed, FenestrationSurface:Detailed,
and Shading:Zone:Detailed input objects. These input objects are seldom created by graphical user
interfaces, so it is unlikely that you will see them. Some of these input objects also have simpler
methods for specifying geometry, such as using a single vertex, height, width, tilt, and azimuth or
just specifying the fin location relative to the window edge. The following is a list of these input
object variations for surfaces:38 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS


• Wall:Detailed, Wall:Exterior, Wall:Adiabatic, Wall:Underground, Wall:Interzone
• RoofCeiling:Detailed, Roof
• Floor:Detailed, Floor:GroundContact, Floor:Adiabatic, Floor:Interzone
• Ceiling:Adiabatic, Ceiling:Interzone
• Window, Window:Interzone
• Door, GlazedDoor, Door:Interzone, GlazedDoor:Interzone
• Shading:Site, Shading:Building, Shading:Overhang, Shading:Overhang:Projection, Shading:Fin,
Shading:Fin:Projection


Other Related Input Objects
• GlobalGeometryRules - A required input object that should be in all files. It sets the way
geometry is specified for all of the surface input objects. The most common approach is
that the order of coordinates for each surface should start with the upper left corner (when
viewed from “outside” the zone with the surface) and that the coordinates should proceed
in a counter-clockwise order. In addition, most common is to use a world coordinate system
where all the vertices are based on a single coordinate system for the entire building rather
than one that changes relative to each zone. However, if you want to rotate the building, then
you must specify Relative coordinates, and the zone origins may all remain at (0,0,0).

• WindowShadingControl - for a window, describes the kind of movable shading (interior shade,
interior blind, between glass shade, exterior blind, etc..) as well as how it is controlled and
the physical material of the shade or window construction with the shade. Good examples
are in the PurchAirWithDaylightingAndShadeControl.idf file.

• WindowProperty:FrameAndDivider - defines the frame material around a window and any
dividers between separate lites of the window (see Figure X). While a window does not
necessarily need to define the frame, it is a more accurate approach since the heat transfer
through the frame usually has significant impacts the overall performance of a window. Note
that the area of the Fenestration:Detailed object is the glazed area without the frame. The
frame extends beyond the glazed area. See the PurchAirWithDaylighting.idf example file.

• WindowProperty:AirflowControl - defines windows that have forced air flow between the
panes of glass, also called heat-extract windows or climate windows. See the example file
AirflowWindowsAndBetweenGlassBlinds.idf.
• WindowProperty:StormWindow - allows the definition of a movable storm window that is
usually applied to a window in the winter. See the StormWindow.idf example file.
• InternalMass - used to define thermal mass that is not described anywhere else in the model
- often used to capture the effect of furnishings or interior floors that are not being modeled.
Used in many example files including RefBldgLargeOffceNew2004_Chicago.idf.4.5. THERMAL ZONES AND SURFACES 39
Figure 4.4: A window with frame and divider40 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
• ShadingProperty:Reflectance - specifying the reflectance properties for shading and is
only needed if the input object Building specifies the “with reflections” option. See the
ReflectiveAdjacentBuilding.idf example file.
Other less common input objects include ZoneList and ZoneGroup that can be used when doing
multi-story simulations and GeometryTransform which allows a building model to be stretched with
just a few inputs.
4.6 Internal Gains
Inside a building, people, appliances, offce equipment, lighting, and other devices produce heat.
The combination of all these items that produce heat within a building are called internal gains and
represents a significant contribution, sometimes the largest contribution, to the cooling requirements
for a building. In addition, they offset the amount of heat from the HVAC system that is needed
at a given time. Typically, the peak value is entered in the input objects for this group such as the
maximum number of people, the total power of equipment, or the total lighting power and then a
schedule is used to modify that value each hour of the year. It is just as critical that the schedule
values are realistic for your building as is the peak value. For almost all buildings, it is rare that the
peak occupancy occurs for more than a few hours per year if at all and this is especially the case
for retail stores, theaters, and sports complexes. Even offce buildings when counting vacations and
people out of the building for meetings will rarely have peak occupancy.
The most common internal gain input objects that are shown in almost all the example files are:

• People – specifies not only the sensible, latent and radiant heat from people but also includes
ways of reporting the comfort of occupants using a variety of thermal comfort models. The
DynamicClothing.idf example file shows how to use the thermal comfort models.

• Lights – describes the heat related to lighting systems.

• ElectricEquipment – describes the heat related to electrical appliances, offce equipment, and
other heat sources that are powered by electricity.

• GasEquipment - specifies the heat related to cooking appliances and other equipment that
uses natural gas.

Less common internal gains input objects include:
• OtherEquipment - describes any heat gain or loss (sensible, radiant, and/or latent) that
impacts the space but does not consume utility energy in the simulation. Typically used to
model a process load which is not to be included in the overall building energy consumption.
• ElectricEquipment:ITE:AirCooled - see the 1ZoneDataCenterCRAC_wApproachTemp.idf
example file.
• SwimmingPool:Indoor - see the 5ZoneSwimmingPool.idf example file.
Other4.7. DAYLIGHTING 41
• ComfortViewFactorAngles – allows the specification of how different surfaces impact the
thermal comfort calculations for the occupants. See the PurchAirWithDaylightingAngleFac.idf
example file.
The Internal Gains group also contains input objects related to zone contaminant sources and sinks.
The input objects include modeling components that impact contaminant concentrations which are
scheduled, pressure driven, use a cut off model, assume a decaying source, surface diffusion, or using
a deposition velocity model. The input objects described in this section are further explained in
the InputOutputReference under the heading “Group-Internal Gains.”

4.7 Daylighting
Reducing the amount of powered lighting that is used when suffcient natural daylight illuminates
the interior building through windows and skylights is called daylighting. Automatics daylighting
control systems are a very common energy effciency measure in buildings and are often required
for new building designs depending on the energy code that applies to the building location. The
most common input objects related to daylighting are:

• Daylighting:Controls – specifies the algorithm used for daylighting, the dimming of lights is
continuous or stepped, and how glare calculations are performed.

• Daylighting:ReferencePoint – specifies the location of the sensors for the daylighting control
system.

The InputOutputReference includes not only a description of these input objects but also extra
guidance on how they should be applied. The PurchAirWithDaylighting.idf contains examples of
these input objects.
Figure 4.5: Daylighting with Continuous Dimming42 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
Three different devices can be used with daylighting:

• DaylightingDevice:Tubular - see the DaylightingDeviceTubular.idf example file.

• DaylightingDevice:Shelf - see the DaylightingDeviceShelf.idf example file.

• DaylightingDevice:LightWell - see the GeometryTest.idf example file.

An input object called Daylighting:DELight:ComplexFenestration is used with one of the two control
methods specified in the Daylighting:Controls input object when used in conjunction with complex
fenestration systems such as prismatic and holographic glass.
Some flexibility is given to provide extra output related to daylighting and includes:
• Output:DaylightFactors – creates a special report on the factors used in daylighting. See the
ReportDaylightFactors.idf example file.
• Output:IlluminanceMap – allows the generation of maps of illuminance values within each
interior zone that uses daylighting controls. The exact file format can be set using the
OutputControl:IlluminanceMap:Style input object. See the DaylightingDeviceTubular.idf for
example of both input objects.
More details of these output options can be found in the OutputDetailsAndExamples document.
The input objects described in this section are further explained in the InputOutputReference under
the heading “Group-Daylighting.”
4.8 Advanced Construction, Surface, Zone Concepts
The group of input objects contains many special cases for more sophisticated modeling for
constructions, surfaces, and zones. As part of this, one of the ways to model building foundations
called Kiva is described. See the ZoneCoupledKivaBasement.idf and ZoneCoupledKivaSlab.idf
example files for example of these input objects.

• Foundation:Kiva - describes the insulation depth and width for interior and exterior horizontal
and vertical insulated foundations as well as the construction for the wall footing, see Figure
X .

• Foundation:Kiva:Settings - sets the soil conditions and other parameters related to the
Foundation:Kiva input object.

• SurfaceProperty:ExposedFoundationPerimeter - used to set the portion of the foundation
that is along the exterior perimeter of the building that undergoes heat transfer with the
environment. Edges of underground surfaces that are fully under the building and not along
the perimeter are not expected to have any heat transfer with the environment.

Input objects of interest in this group not related to Kiva include
• SurfaceControl:MovableInsulation - allows the modeling of insulation panels that are
removable for walls, floors, and roofs but not windows. See MovableExtInsulationSimple.idf

and MovableIntInsulationLightsLowE.idf example files.4.8. ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION, SURFACE, ZONE CONCEPTS 43
Figure 4.6: Structural and insulation components of Foundation:Kiva input objects44 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS

• SurfaceProperty:Underwater - allows the outside of the building to be modeled as underwater
and even as moving through the water allowing EnergyPlus to model vessels. See the
VaryingLocationAndOrientation.idf example file.
• SurfaceProperty:ExteriorNaturalVentedCavity - provides a method to include the modeling
of baffles in the multi-skin exteriors. See the HP_wICSSolarCollector.idf example file.
Other input objects in this group set the heat transfer algorithms for specific surfaces to override
the building level heat transfer algorithm, when other models are used to describe the variation
in temperature on the outside of a surface, override the algorithm used for modeling convection
heat transfer between the air inside or outside of a zone and the surface, vapor transfer coeffcients
when using algorithms that include moisture modeling of surfaces, override the algorithm that
distributes the solar radiation on interior surfaces, overrides the solar energy absorbed by different
layers for complex windows, a way to override the longwave radiation with other surfaces in the
zone, allows overriding the external environment for a surface or a zone including solar shading or
airspeed or temperature or humidity, overrides the source term for the heat balance, or overrides
the view factors for a zone. The input objects described in this section are further explained in the
InputOutputReference under the heading “Group-Advanced Surface Concepts.”
4.9 Exterior Equipment
While equipment that is outside of a building does not impact the thermal performance of the
building, the accounting of all end-uses including those outside of the building is important
for many compliance and incentive programs that require building energy modeling. See the
ExteriorLightsAndEq.idf example file for these input objects.

• Exterior:Lights - describes the external site lighting for the building grounds, entrances, and
facades which are either controlled by a schedule or when the sun is set.

• Exterior:FuelEquipment - describes other energy consumption on the site that is external to
the building other than lighting.
• Exterior:WaterEquipment - describes the flow rate of water use on the building site outside
of the building.
The input objects described in this section are further explained in the InputOutputReference under
the heading “Group-Exterior Energy Use Equipment.”
4.10 Zone Airflow
The Zone Airflow input object group provides a way to model the airflow between zones and airflow
due to natural ventilation (e.g., open windows) or mechanically-induced ventilation (e.g., exhaust
air fans.

• ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate - provides a way to describe the air infiltration into a building
through leaks in the envelope including around windows or the normal operation of doors.
The leakage can be a function of temperature and wind speed and can be expressed as either
a total flow rate, a flow rate per floor area, per wall area, or as an air change rate. This input
object appears in most example files.4.11. HVAC TEMPLATES 45

• ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea - similar to the previous input object but uses a
different equation to express the infiltration rate. The DirectIndirectEvapCoolers.idf file
contains an example.

• ZoneInfiltration:FlowCoeffcient - also similar to the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate input
object but uses yet a different equation.The DirectIndirectEvapCoolers.idf file contains an
example.

• ZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRate - a method to add outside air to a zone with similar inputs
to the ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate but this would represent a purposeful introduction of
outdoor air into the space. See the 5ZoneNightVent2.idf example file.

• ZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenArea - describes the natural ventilation driven
introduction of outdoor air into the zone using a simpler method than an AirflowNetwork
model. The inputs include the opening area and effectiveness as well as simple controls based
on zone or outdoor temperature or the difference between the two or wind speed. See the
VentilationSimpleTest.idf file.

• ZoneMixing, ZoneCrossMixing, and ZoneRefrigerationDoorMixing - these three input objects
provide simplified treatments of air exchange between zones.

• ZoneEarthtube - provides a way to model an earth tube which is a way to draw outdoor into
the zone through an underground pipe in order to cool the air in the summer and heat it in
the winter. An example of this input object is in the EarthTubeSimpleTest.idf file.
• ZoneCoolTower:Shower - models a passive downdraught evaporative cooling tower
(sometimes also called a shower cooling tower or a wind tower) using natural ventilation
and water evaporation to providing cooling in typically arid climates. See the
CooltowerSimpleTestwithVentilation.idf for an example of this input object.
• ZoneThermalChimney - models a passive solar driven thermal chimney that utilize the
buoyancy of air heated by the sun to provide ventilation. See the file ThermalChimneyTest.idf.
• ZoneAirBalance:OutdoorAir - calculates the combined outdoor airflow including the
interactions between mechanical ventilation, infiltration, and duct leakage and is usually
applied to residential buildings. See the SingleFamilyHouse_TwoSpeed_ZoneAirBalance.idf
file for example.
The input objects described in this section are further explained in the InputOutputReference under
the heading “Group-Airflow.”
4.11 HVAC Templates
New users to EnergyPlus need to learn many things to understand how to create detailed input
objects for modeling an HVAC system. In order to reduce this initial effort, HVACTemplates were
created. Unlike other input objects, the HVACTemplate input objects are not directly processed
by EnergyPlus; instead, a preprocessor called ExpandObjects turns these HVACTemplate input
objects into the detailed HVAC input objects. This can be used as a learning tool since you can46 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
review the .expidf file that contains the detailed input objects or it can be used for long term
modeling especially if your focus is not on HVAC related energy effciency measures. The primary
disadvantage of using the HVACTemplate input objects is that only a small subset of possible
configurations can be modeled using them; however, the subset of configurations supported by
the HVACTemplate input objects was carefully chosen to be some of the most common HVAC
configurations. If the HVACTemplate input objects do not support the HVAC configuration you
are considering; you need to model it with the detailed HVAC EnergyPlus input objects. When
using HVACTemplate input objects, no regular EnergyPlus input objects related to HVAC should
be used (see the InputOutputReference for some exceptions to this). The HVACTemplates can
model:
• Baseboard heating systems with optional hot water boiler
• Fan coil systems with boilers and chillers
• Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) system with optional hot water boiler
• Packaged terminal air-to-air heat pump (PTHP) systems
• Water to air heat pumps with boiler and cooling tower
• Variable refrigerant flow heat pumps (air-to-air)
• Variable refrigerant flow heat pumps (water-to-air) with boiler and cooling tower
• Direct-expansion (DX) cooling, package and split systems
• Direct-expansion (DX) heat pump systems
• Packaged variable air volume system using direct-expansion cooling
• Variable air volume systems with boilers and air-cooled chillers
• Variable air volume systems with boilers and water-cooled chillers
• Constant air volume systems with boilers and water-cooled chillers
• Dual-duct systems (constant or variable air volume) with boilers and water-cooled chillers
• Dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) combined with zonal template systems
The Input Output Reference includes a list of exactly which input objects are needed for each of
these configurations

• HVACTemplate:Thermostat - describes the heating and cooling setpoints for a thermostat.
This input object can be referenced by multiple HVACTemplate:Zone input objects if all the
zones have the same setpoints.

• HVACTemplate:Zone:IdealLoadsAirSystem - provides an idealized system that supplies air to
the zone that meets all loads and uses no energy. Best used for load calculations.

• HVACTemplate:Zone:BaseboardHeat - allows the simulation of electric or hot water
thermostatically controlled baseboard heaters.4.11. HVAC TEMPLATES 47

• HVACTemplate:Zone:FanCoil - describes a four-pipe fan coil system with outdoor air intake.

• HVACTemplate:Zone:PTAC - models a packaged terminal air conditioner with either electric,
gas or hot water heating coil most commonly used in residential or hotel applications.

• HVACTemplate:Zone:PTHP - models a packaged terminal heat pump system most commonly
used in residential or hotel applications with either electric or gas supplementary heater.

• HVACTemplate:Zone:WaterToAirHeatPump - describes the distributed “terminal” portions

input objects. Example for these are in the ExampleFiles directory and start with the name
HVACTempate. All of these are described in the “Input/Output Reference” document under the
Group “HVACTemplates” and please note that this group is described in Chapter 2 while most of
the other groups of input objects are described in Chapter 1. The expansion process is described
in the Auxiliary Programs document under “ExpandObjects.”
4.12 Detailed HVAC
In buildings, HVAC systems are comprised of components such as fans, pumps, coils, chillers and
boilers connected by ducts or pipes and controlled by systems using sensors strategically located in
the distribution systems and in the zones. In many respects, EnergyPlus mirrors this topology by
having a large number of components and a means to describe their connections with one another
and their control systems. Every component in an HVAC system must have an inlet and outlet
“node.” In the actual system, a node might be a point in the system at which fluid properties
can be measured. In an EnergyPlus simulation, the nodes are points at which fluid properties are
evaluated and passed on to subsequent equipment. Components are linked together to form various4.12. DETAILED HVAC 49
loops within the simulation. Thus, the output node from one component also serves as the inlet
node to the next component. Loops are constructed combining the components as well as input
objects the describe the arrangement of the components. The figure below shows a generic example
of the loop-node concept. Loop nodes are a key defining feature in EnergyPlus. As a result, it is
recommended that one of the first steps taken in defining an HVAC system in EnergyPlus be the
definition of a node diagram or map. This is helpful for visualization of the entire system.
Figure 4.7: Example Node Diagram
So that these loops are manageable and more clearly defined both in the input and in the
simulation, four different loop sections can be defined in an EnergyPlus input file. In general, these
four types are in essence two pairs of loop sections that make up two distinct types of loops: a
zone/air loop and a plant loop.
• Air Loop Supply Side: The air loop is defined by the section of the zone/air loop that
starts after the zone return streams are combined and continues on until just before any air
stream(s) are branched off to individual zones. The starting point of the air loop is fairly
straightforward. The ending point is slightly more complex but can be understood with some
examples. For instance, in a terminal reheat system, the end of the air loop would typically
be considered the node following the cooling coil. In a dual duct system, the air loop would50 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
have two ending points that would correspond to the nodes after the cooling coil and after
the heating coil/humidifier. In most cases, the air loop has a single starting point and up to
two ending points (for a two-deck system). An outdoor air subsystem can be included in the
supply side for ventilation and relief air.
• Air Loop Zone Equipment: The zone equipment section of the input file is defined as more
or less the rest of the zone/air loop (outside air is handled separately as a subset of the air
loop). This includes everything from where the ducts are split to serve various zones up
through where the return ducts from various zones are mixed into a single return duct. Zone
equipment can include dampers and reheat coils as well as zone-specific conditioning systems
such as thermostatic baseboard or a window air conditioner. Most control issues are typically
dealt with in the zone equipment section of the simulation.
• Plant Loop Demand Side: One side of the plant is where energy is “demanded” by various
components that make up the air loop or zone equipment. Typically, this is the water side
of equipment such as coils, baseboard, radiant heating and cooling, etc. In the case of a
condenser loop, energy is typically “demanded” by a chiller condenser or other water source
heat pump. The demand side of this loop can also include a splitter, a mixer, and a bypass.
• Plant Loop Supply Side: The other side of the plant loop is where energy is “supplied” by
various components. The components typically found on the supply side include pumps,
boilers, chillers, purchased heating and cooling, ice storage, etc. In the case of a condenser,
the components would be a cooling tower, fluid cooler, or ground source heat exchanger, etc.
As with the demand side, this loop can also include a splitter, a mixer, and a bypass.

4.13 Output Reporting
The primary goal of modeling is seeing the results of the model contained in the output
reporting. EnergyPlus has several different types of outputs, but initially the most important
to understand are the tabular output reports that summarize the results of the simulation. The
Output:Table:SummaryReports and OutputControl:Table:Style input objects described below are
the only two necessary to start generating the tabular output reports:
• Output:Table:SummaryReports - allows the specification of different tabular reports but
usually just specifying AllSummary is necessary. Additional reports can be shown by
specifying AllSummaryAndMonthly, AllSummaryMonthlyAndSizingPeriod.4.13. OUTPUT REPORTING 53
• OutputControl:Table:Style - specifying the output format for the tabular reports which is
most commonly HTML but a comma, tab, fixed width, and XML options are also available.
Depending on what is specified the output reports can have different file extensions and the
file name usually has the word “Table” or “tbl” in it.
You can also create your own custom tabular reports by using one of the following input objects:
• Output:Table:TimeBins - shows the amount of time in hours that occurs in different bins for
the single specific output variable or meter specified
• Output:Table:Monthly - shows a series of output variables or output meters on a monthly
basis using different aggregation schemes. For output variables that reoccur for each zone or
other input objects, the monthly report will be repeated for each one.
• Output:Table:Annual - shows a series of output variables or output meters on an annual basis
using different aggregation schemes. For output variables that reoccur for each zone or other
input objects, additional rows of results will be displayed.
• Output:VariableDictionary - provides a list of available output variables for use with these
custom tabular reports as well as the time step reporting described next. The list of output
variables that are available for specific simulation appear in a file with a .rdd extension, and
the output meters appear in a file with a .mdd extension.
When you need to dive deeper into the results for a specific output variable or output meters,
time step outputs allow you to see the values of an output variable for each timestep or other time
periods. By looking at multiple output variables and seeing how they change together over time, a
deeper understanding of the system and control operation can be gained.
• Output:Variable - these input objects are added one for each output variable desired. Usually,
an asterisk is used for the “key value” field so that all instances of the output variable are
included. The output shows up in the .eso file which is generally converted to a .csv file for
use with a spreadsheet.
• Output:Meter and Output:Meter:MeterFileOnly - these input objects specify the output
meters (think of them as very detailed submeters). The output from these input objects show
up in the .mtr file which is generally converted to a Meter.csv file for use with a spreadsheet.
Also, note that the .mtd file shows the exact relationship between specific end-use output
report variables and each output meter.
• Output:SQLite - use this input object if you want to output in the SQLite database format.
Not only can the output variables and meters be in SQLite format but the tabular reports
are also included.
EnergyPlus also includes a number of special reports that usually appear in different output files
or in the .eio output file
• Output:Surfaces:List - provides a report on all the surfaces in a file and the output appears
in the .eio and .sln output files.
• Output:Surfaces:Drawing - provides a DXF drawing that can be opened in some CAD
programs .54 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
• OutputControl:SurfaceColorScheme - controls the colors used in the DXF file.
• Output:Schedules - provides a summary of the schedules in the input file and appears as part
of the file with the .eio extension.
• Output:Constructions - provides a summary of constructions in the input file and appears as
part of the file with the .eio extension.
• Output:EnergyManagementSystem - creates a list of detailed output related to the energy
management system in a file with the .edd extension.
• OutputControl:ReportingTolerances - provides more control over the amount of time reported
for the setpoints not being met.
• Output:Diagnostics - provides additional detail in the output messages in the .err file .
Normally this extra detail is not shown to reduce confusion for new users.
• Output:DebuggingData - provides an additional detailed output related to HVAC nodes in a
file with a .dbg extension.
Environmental reporting adds new meters showing the emissions related to the building and is
triggered by the use of the following three input objects. See the 5ZoneTDV.idf file for examples.
• Output:EnvironmentalImpactFactors - specifies the frequency of the output variables related
to emissions.
• EnvironmentalImpactFactors - specifies the effciency of district heating and cooling systems
as well as the carbon equivalent emission factors for N20, CH4, and CO2.
• FuelFactors - for each type of energy resource (electricity, natural gas, etc..) provides a way
to enter factors related to source energy and emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, N20, SO2,
PM, NH3, NMVOC, Hg, Pb, and other factors.
Other input objects in this group allow the accumulation of metered results, the combination of
output variables or meters to create custom meters, and a method for preprocessors to include error
messages in the normal error file. Many example files contain some of these input objects. All
of these are described in the “Input/Output Reference” but note that this group is described in
Chapter 5 “Input for Output” and Chapter 7 “Standard Output Reports” while most of the other
groups of input objects are described in Chapter 1. The OutputDetailsAndExamples documentation
provides even more details on the outputs created by each of these input objects. Several other
output related input objects appear in other areas such as Output:DaylightFactors input object in
the Daylighting group.
4.14 Economics
EnergyPlus contains several input objects that allow economic analysis to be performed. When
these input objects are included in the input file, new tabular output reports are automatically
generated. The input objects used by EnergyPlus for cost estimating calculations are as follows:4.14. ECONOMICS 55
• ComponentCost:LineItem - provides inputs related to determining the construction cost and
can be associated with several different input objects and the cost estimate is based on factors
such as cost per area or cost per unit of output capacity. It has not been applied to all types of
input objects so for many scenarios; construction costing would need to be performed outside
of EnergyPlus.
• ComponentCost:Adjustments - allows the specification of adjustments including miscellaneous
costs per conditioned area, design and engineering fees, contractor fees, contingency,
permitting, bonding, and insurance as well as commissioning and regional adjustment fees.
• ComponentCost:Reference - entry of reference building costs so that the current model can
be compared to the reference building.
For many building projects, while energy estimates are important, the computation of estimated
utility bills provides an understanding of how much money is going to be saved to help offset possibly
higher initial costs of a high-performance building. Due to the many different utility companies
and regulatory agencies, the approach used to compute monthly utility bills has become widely
varied and, at times, quite complicated depending not only on energy and demand but the timing
of each and the relationship between the two. Overall, the goals of the UtilityCost input objects
of EnergyPlus are to make simple tariffs easy to model and complex tariffs possible to model. The
5ZoneEconomicsTariffAndLifeCycleCosts.idf example file provides several different example tariffs.
The input objects used by EnergyPlus for the calculation of monthly and annual utility bills are as
follows:
• UtilityCost:Tariff - sets the parameters for the overall tariff such as associated output meter,
conversion factors, demand computation, monthly charges, and minimum charges, and
schedule names for the time of use periods, seasons, billing cycle, and real-time pricing.
• UtilityCost:Qualify - provides a method to qualify if a tariff applies to the building being
modeled since utilities provide limits usually based on peak demand or energy consumption
for each tariff.
• UtilityCost:Charge:Simple - defines cost per unit value for a charge based on energy or demand
or other charges for a specific season. The charges are arranged in a hierarchy shown in Figure
X Hierarchy of Economic Charges.
• UtilityCost:Charge:Block - defines a more complicated but common type of charge for energy
or demand where the costs are defined in the tariff with blocks of charges (i.e., the first 1000
kWh is one cost per kWh, the next 5000 kWh is a second cost, and remaining kWh is a third
cost). Like UtilityCost:Charge:Simple, the charges use the same hierarchy.
• UtilityCost:Ratchet - some utilities charge not only for the current month’s demand but
also compensate for the highest demand in recent months, and this input object allows the
specification of such a structure.
The following two input objects are uncommon to use:
• UtilityCost:Variable - allows the specific specification of a monthly variable to be used in the
calculation of the tariff.56 CHAPTER 4. INPUT OBJECT GROUPS
Figure 4.9: Hierarchy of Economic Charges
• UtilityCost:Computation - provides the step-by-step specification of the steps needed to
compute the tariff. The output report tariff summary includes the default computation steps
for the input objects specified.
Life-cycle costing allows the combination of initial and future costs (typically energy bills) to be
understood using a single metric so that multiple building energy models can be compared even if
they all have different initial and future costs. The input objects used for performing a life-cycle
cost analysis are:
• LifeCycleCost:Parameters - describes the discount, tax, and inflation rates, the approach used
for inflation and discounting, as well as the base date and length of the study period and other
parameters related to life-cycle costing.
• LifeCycleCost:RecurringCosts - used to enter reoccurring costs other than costs related to
energy and water usage since those are included automatically.
• LifeCycleCost:NonrecurringCost - used to enter costs that occur only once during the study
period.
• LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation - specifies the annual escalation of energy costs in future
years and is generally based on government predictions. The increases in energy costs for
future years are assuming they change differently than inflation. A file that is updated
each year begins with the name LCCusePriceEscalationDataSet is included in the DataSets
directory and is based on supplements to the NIST 135 handbook.
Two less commonly used input objects are
• LifeCycleCost:UseAdjustment - allows manual adjustment of energy or water costs in future
years.
• CurrencyType - specifies the currency symbol of the monetary unit. If it is not included a
dollar sign ’$’ is used in all reports.
All of these are described in the “Input/Output Reference” but note that this group is described in
Chapter 3 “EnergyPlus Economics” while most of the other groups of input objects are described
in Chapter 1. The OutputDetailsAndExamples documentation provides even more details on the
tabular outputs created in the section labeled “eplustbl.<ext>
