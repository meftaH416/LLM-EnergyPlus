Group - Air Path
AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPath, AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath
The zone supply and return air paths are used to describe the configuration of the flow path that the supply air takes in moving from the main air handler to the zone terminal units and that the return air takes on leaving the zones and returning to the central return air duct. The air paths consist of a group of components AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitters and AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenums for the supply path and AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenums and AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixers for the return path. The connectivity of the paths is established by the components node connections. There are no branches defined in the zone air path constructs.
For a typical single duct air system there will be oneAirLoopHVAC:SupplyPathand oneAirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath.A typical dual duct system would have 2 AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPaths one for the hot air and one for the cold air and 1AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath.
TheAirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenumcomponent provides the capability to have supply air distributed to the conditioned zones through one or more plenum zones such as would occur in an underfloor air distribution system (UFAD). TheAirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenumcomponent allows the program to model return air plenums. Of course plenums are always optional. The simplestAirLoopHVAC:SupplyPathwould consist of only anAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter;similarly the simplest return air path consists of a singleAirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer.A UFAD system supply air path might consist of a singleAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitterconnecting to multiple AirLoopHVAC:SupplyPlenums which in turn could each supply one or more conditioned zones. A system with return plenums would have anAirLoopHVAC:ReturnPathin which the conditioned zones connect to the return plenum inlets and the outlets of the return plenum connect to a singleAirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer.
Both the zone supply and return plenums are solved in the heat balance as thermal zones which couple through heat conduction with adjacent zones. Since they are solved as thermal zones the solution scheme involves the zone predictor-corrector technique which will lag the temperature at the system timestep in every zone. See Summary of Predictor-Corrector Procedure in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.
Below are the descriptions of the zone supply and return path statements. Note that each statement type has an identifying name, a single inlet/outlet node name, and a list of component type/name pairs. For a single zone being served by an air loop, the inlet to its air distribution unit and the zone return air outlet can be the zone equipment inlet and outlet nodes directly, thus eliminating the need to specify anAirLoopHVAC:SupplyPathand anAirLoopHVAC:ReturnPath.

AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum
The simple building shown in the figure below consists of a controlled zone and a return plenum zone that is used for the return air. This simple configuration contains a ground floor controlled zone with a window and a return plenum zone which handles the roof load. The return air plenum is a special type of component since there is both a heat balance connection and building description and a system airflow connection that transfers the airflow directly from the controlled zone to the return plenum zone in the system air simulation. The input described in this section is mainly just for the system airflow connections in the HVAC algorithms. In addition the return plenum zone must be fully input as a zone object for the heat balance calculation. The zone description needs to contain the wall descriptions - the interzone ceiling and floor, and for this simple case the roof. All the other attributes of a zone that can be specified in the building description can be used with a return plenum zone if necessary: scheduled loads, windows, etc.

AirLoopHVAC:ExhaustSystem
TheAirLoopHVAC:ExhaustSystemandZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlobjects are used to describe the way that the exhaust air streams are configured. These objects provide a way for the exhaust air streams from multiple zones to be rerouted and recombined to form a new central exhausts. The exhaust system is composed of a central exhaust fan and a zone mixer).

Central Exhaust Fan Energy [J]
Energy usage of the central exhaust fan in [J].
ZoneHVAC:ExhaustControl
The input fields for theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlobject are as follows.
Inputs
Field: Name
This is the name of theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControl.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This is the availability schedule name of theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlequipment. A schedule value of zero means off, and >0 means on. If the connectedAirloopHVAC:ExhaustSystemis on, then this schedule may be used to turn on (or off) theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlsystem. If the connectedAirloopHVAC:ExhaustSystemis off, then thisZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlsystem will be off, and this schedule will be ignored.
Field: Zone Name
The name of the zone that the exhaust is located within.
Field: Inlet Node Name
This is the inlet node name of theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlobject. This should be an exhaust node of the zone.
Field: Outlet Node Name
This is the outlet node name of theZoneHVAC:ExhaustControlobject. This node must be connected to anAirLoopHVAC:ExhaustSystemobject as an inlet node.
Field: Design Flow Rate m3/s
This numerical field is the design exhaust flow rate of the exhaust system in [m3/s]. This field could be autosized. The default is autosize.
Field: Flow Control Type
This field is the control type on how the exhaust flows are controlled. The available choices are:ScheduledorFollowSupply.Scheduledmeans that the target exhaust flow rate will be the Design Flow Rate times the Flow Fraction Schedule.FollowSupplymeans that the target exhaust flow rate will be the current total flow rate at the node(s) specified in Supply Node orNodeListName times the Flow Fraction Schedule. For both control types, if the central exhaust fan is not able to meet the total target exhaust flow rate for all of its inlets, then the flow rate will be reduced proportionally to match the available fan flow.
Field: Flow Fraction Schedule Name
This is the schedule name for the exhaust flow fraction. If left empty, the default value is 1.0. This schedule is only applied for Flow Control Type - Schedules.
Field: Supply Node or NodeList Name
This is the supply air node or nodelist name used for theFollowSupplyflow control type.
Field: Minimum Zone Temperature Limit Schedule Name
This will be the minimum zone temperature limit schedule name. It will be used to shut down the exhaust flow rate to the Minimum Flow Fraction Schedule value if the zone temperature get below this limit.
Field: Minimum Flow Fraction Schedule Name
This is the schedule name for the minimum exhaust flow fraction. If left empty, the default value would be 1.0.
Field: Balanced Exhaust Fraction Schedule Name
This field is optional. If it is not used, then all the exhaust air flow is assumed to be unbalanced by any simple air flows, such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing. Unbalanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by the outdoor air system in the central air system. The modeling of unbalanced will reduce the flow rates at the zone's return air node by the flow rate that is being exhausted and will ensure that the outdoor air flow rate is sufficient to serve the exhaust. If this field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. This fraction is applied to the exhaust fan flow rate and the model tracks the portion of the exhaust that is balanced. Balanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by simple airflows and does not impact the central air system return air or outdoor air flow rates. For example, if a kitchen zone with an exhaust fan is designed to draw half of its make up air from a neighboring dining room and the other half from the outdoor air system, then a schedule value of 0.5 could be used here. This input field must be blank when the zone air flow balance is enforced. If user specifies a schedule and zone air flow balance is enforced, then EnergyPlus throws a warning error message, ignores the schedule and simulation continues.
