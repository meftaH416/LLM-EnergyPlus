Group - Humidifiers and Dehumidifiers
Humidifier:Steam:Electric
The electric steam humidifier is a component that represents an electrically heated, self contained steam humidifier. The component uses electrical energy to convert ordinary tap water to steam which it then injects into the supply air stream by means of a blower fan. The actual unit might be an electrode-type humidifier or a resistance-type humidifier.
The humidifier model includes local control of the humidifier unit to meet a humidity ratio setpoint on its air outlet node. A set point manager is needed to put a setpoint on the exit node but no other local controllers are needed. The humidifier will add moisture to meet the humidity ratio setpoint.

This object models a solid desiccant dehumidifier (excluding associated fans). The process air stream is the air which is dehumidified. The regen air stream is the air which is heated to regenerate the desiccant. This object determines the process air outlet conditions, the load on the regeneration heating coil, the electric power consumption for the wheel rotor motor, and the regeneration air fan mass flow rate. All other heat exchangers are modeled as separate objects connected to the inlet and outlet nodes of the dehumidifier. The solid desiccant dehumidifier is typically used in anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemobject, but can also be specified in anyAirLoopHVAC.The regeneration heating coil can be Gas, Electric, Steam , or Hot Water coil. When hot water coil is selected as regeneration heating coil user-defined curves designed for lower temperature operation must be specified in the input field Performance Model Type along with the Nominal Regeneration Temperature input field.

Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System
TheDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject models the dehumidification of an air stream, normally called the process air stream. A second heated air stream, called the regeneration air stream, is used to remove the collected moisture from the desiccant heat exchanger and this moisture-laden air is then usually exhausted from the building. ThisDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject is similar to theDehumidifier:Desiccant:NoFansobject but has some additional modeling capabilities.
TheDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject in EnergyPlus is a compound object that can be placed anywhere in an air loop(AirLoopHVAC).Common locations for this object are in anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemor in the main air loop(AirLoopHVAC)downstream of a cooling coil (postcooling desiccant dehumidifier). This compound object coordinates the operation of several children objects: a desiccant heat exchanger, a regeneration air fan, and an optional regeneration air heater. Gas, Electric, Steam, or Hot Water heating coils can be used for regenerator air heaters. If this dehumidifier is placed in the main air loop immediately downstream of a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, then the dehumidifier's operation can be coordinated with the operation of the companion DX coil and it is also possible to specify that the DX system's condenser waste heat can be used to help regenerate the desiccant heat exchanger. For the case of condenser waste heat regeneration, an optional exhaust fan can also be modeled by this desiccant dehumidifier compound object to help maintain a set point temperature for air entering the regeneration side of the desiccant heat exchanger.
It is important to note that the optional exhaust air fan is modeled internal to theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemand a separate fan object shouldnotbe added to the input data file (idf) for this fan. On the other hand, a separate fan objectisrequired in the input data file for the regeneration air fan.

A schematic of the compound object Dehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemis shown in Figure1with the draw through regeneration air fan placement. Figure2shows theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject configured with the blow through regeneration air fan placement.
NOTE: As with any air loop compound object, theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject itself is specified on theAirLoopHVACBranchor in theAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem:EquipmentListfor anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem.The children objects (e.g., desiccant heat exchanger, regeneration air fan, and optional regeneration air heater) must be specified separately in the input data file and their inlet/outlet connections must be as shown in Figure1or Figure2.

Currently the only heat exchanger choice for this object is HeatExchanger:Desiccant: BalancedFlow. So to model aDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemlocated in an air loop, the input data file should include the following objects:

If the user wants to model theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemin anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem,then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the outdoor air stream and the regeneration air path may be placed in the relief air stream or modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier itself where the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node. If the user wants to model theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemin an air loop(AirLoopHVAC)Branch,then the process air path of the dehumidifier should be located in the air loopBranchobject. For this case, the regeneration air stream is modeled by the desiccant dehumidifier object itself (i.e., not part of an air loopBranchstatement) and the first node for the regeneration inlet air stream must be an outdoor air node (ref. Figure1or Figure2).
A description of each input field for this object is provided below:
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique, user-assigned name for a particularDehumidifier:Desiccant:System.Any reference to this dehumidifier by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the dehumidifier can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the dehumidifier can operate. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate (i.e., no heat exchange will take place and the regeneration air fan does not operate). If the field is blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods. For the case where companion cooling coil regeneration air heating has been specified, the desiccant dehumidifier's exhaust fan serves as the condenser air fan for the cooling coil system so this availability schedule will not disable exhaust fan operation.
Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Object Type
This alpha field contains the type of desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier. Currently, the only valid choice isHeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow.
Field: Desiccant Heat Exchanger Name
This alpha field contains the name of the desiccant heat exchanger used with this dehumidifier.
Field: Sensor Node Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the air loop node used to control desiccant heat exchanger operation. A set point manager must be used to place a maximum humidity ratio set point on this node (e.g.,SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:MaximumorSetpointManager:OutdoorAirPretreat).
Field: Regeneration Air Fan Object Type
This alpha field contains the type of regeneration air fan used. Available fan types areFan:SystemModel,Fan:OnOffandFan:ConstantVolume.
Field: Regeneration Air Fan Name
This alpha field contains the name of the regeneration air fan used with this dehumidifier.
Field: Regeneration Air Fan Placement
This alpha field specifies the fan configuration used in the desiccant dehumidifier. Valid choices are BlowThrough and DrawThrough , with a default of DrawThrough if this field is left blank.
Field: Regeneration Air Heater Object Type
This alpha field contains the type of heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the regeneration air heating coil does not require additional controller orController:WaterCoilobject. The parent object(Dehumidifier:Desiccant:System)itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow. For autosizing regeneration air heating coil theDesign Coil Inlet Air Conditionused is the outdoor air condition if the desiccant system is on the primary air loop, or else if the desiccant system is on outdoor air system then it is the return air condition. TheDesign Coil Outlet Air Temperatureis theRegeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperaturespecified in the input field below. Valid heating coil choices are:
Coil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Regeneration Air Heater Name
This alpha field contains the name of the heating coil used to heat the regeneration air stream. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required.
Field: Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature
This optional numeric field specifies the regeneration air inlet temperature setpoint in Celsius. The regeneration air heater and/or the companion coil regeneration air heating will be controlled to this temperature to the extent possible. This field may be left blank when no regeneration air heater is required or when control of the exhaust fan used with the companion coil regeneration air heating option is not required. If regeneration air heating coils is autosized, then the value of this input field is used as theRegeneration Air Heater Design Outlet Air Temperaturefor the coil sizing calculation. The default value is 46.0 degrees.
Field: Companion Cooling Coil Object Type
This optional alpha field contains the type of companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. The only valid choices areCoil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed,Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed,andCoil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode.
Field: Companion Cooling Coil Name
This optional alpha field contains the name of the companion cooling coil used with this desiccant dehumidifier. This field may be left blank when no companion cooling coil is being modeled.
Field: Companion Cooling Coil Upstream of Dehumidifier Process Inlet
This choice field specifies if the companion cooling coil is located immediately upstream of the dehumidifiers process inlet. Valid choices are Yes and No. If Yes is selected, then the outlet air node for the companion cooling coil must be the same as the dehumidifier's process air inlet node (i.e., the process air inlet node name for the desiccant heat exchanger specified for this desiccant dehumidifier). For this case, the companion cooling coil and the desiccant dehumidifier are assumed to operate in tandem ; that is, if the simulation determines that the companion cooling coil is unable to meet the humidity set point specified on the sensor node based on its own operation, then the desiccant dehumidifier operates at the same time and for the same duration as the cooling coil to provide improved dehumidification. If No is selected, then the dehumidifier will control to the humidity set point specified on the sensor node to the extent possible. The default value is No if this field is left blank.
Field: Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating
This choice field determines if the companion cooling coil's condenser waste heat is used to heat the regeneration inlet air. Valid choices are Yes and No. The default value is No if this field is left blank.
Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate
This optional numeric field contains the maximum fan volumetric flow rate for the exhaust fan in cubic meters per second. As noted previously, this exhaust fan is modeled internally by theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject and a separate fan object should NOT be specified in the input data file for this fan. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is specified and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields. The model assumes that the exhaust fan will operate as needed to maintain the Regeneration Inlet Air Setpoint Temperature , up to the maximum flow rate specified in this input field. If the desiccant dehumidifier is OFF for a simulation timestep but its companion cooling coil is operating and is specified to provide regeneration air heating, then the exhaust fan operates at this maximum air flow rate (i.e., this fan serves as the condenser fan for the companion cooling coil system when regeneration air heating is specified, so the inputs to the companion cooling coil object should not include the condenser fan energy since the condenser fan energy is modeled by theDehumidifier:Desiccant:Systemobject).
Field: Exhaust Fan Maximum Power
This optional numeric field contains the maximum power for the exhaust fan in Watts (i.e., at the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate). This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name input fields.
Field: Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name
This optional alpha field contains the name of the exhaust fan power modifier curve. This field is used only when a companion cooling coil is used and the Companion Coil Regeneration Air Heating field is set to Yes . This field must be used in conjunction with the Exhaust Fan Maximum Flow Rate and the Exhaust Fan Maximum Power input fields. If this field is blank, the exhaust fan operates (when required) at the maximum power specified in the field above. The curve object type for this Exhaust Fan Power Curve Name must beCurve:CubicorCurve:Quadratic.The curve object(Curve:CubicorCurve:Quadratic)defines the change in exhaust fan power as a function of the ratio of the actual exhaust air flow rate divided by the maximum flow rate.
