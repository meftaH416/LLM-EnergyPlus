Group Demand Limiting Controls
Demand limiting, or demand management, is a strategy for reducing a building's demand for utilities, e.g., electricity. Utility companies typically charge a monthly fee for “demand charges” that is based on the peak demand during a certain time period. Often the peak demand charge is set by one exceptional day that is much higher than the peak demand for an average day during the month. Therefore, to save utility costs, it is in the interest of building owners to find ways to manage the demand on peak days. While demand management is generally concerned with the demand for electricity, the future will likely see demand management of other utilities, such as natural gas or water.
Demand limiting controls shut off or reduce the power to non-essential loads in order to reduce the overall building demand. Some typical controls:
shut off or dim electric lights, equipment, or HVAC systemsreset the thermostatic set points on HVAC systemsreduce the load of a set of similar components by rotating one or more components “off” for a short time intervalturn on generators to meet some or all of the building's demand.
shut off or dim electric lights, equipment, or HVAC systems
reset the thermostatic set points on HVAC systems
reduce the load of a set of similar components by rotating one or more components “off” for a short time interval
turn on generators to meet some or all of the building's demand.
The demand limiting controls implemented in EnergyPlus are intended to allow some of the more common demand limiting strategies. Currently, onlyExterior:Lights,Lights,ElectricEquipment,ZoneControl:Thermostat,andController:OutdoorAirobjects can be demand limited. Additional components will be demand limited in future releases.
DemandManagerAssignmentList
TheDemandManagerAssignmentListobject is a high level control that makes demand limiting decisions based on a list of possible demand limiting strategies. Each demand limiting strategy is described in a separate DemandManager object. (This is structured like the relationship between theAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListand the AvailabilityManager objects.)
EachDemandManagerAssignmentListmonitors and demand limits one meter. Only electricity meters are currently allowed. In many cases, the meter will beElectricity:Facility. A schedule and safety factor are used to set the demand limit above which the DemandManagers become activated. The billing month schedule and demand window are also taken into account when calculating the demand limit.
DemandManagers in the list are activated based on theDemand Manager Priority. If theSequentialoption is used, each manager in the list is activated in sequence from first to last until demand is reduced below the limit or until all managers are activated. If theAlloption is used, all managers are activated simultaneously to achieve the maximum demand reduction.
A DemandManager is skipped if it cannot reduce the demand. Possible reasons that a manager cannot reduce demand include:
not enough load to limitnot available because of itsAvailability Schedulealready activated; load limited during a previous timestep.
not enough load to limit
not available because of itsAvailability Schedule
already activated; load limited during a previous timestep.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of theDemandManagerAssignmentListobject.
Field: Meter Name
This field references the meter that is to be monitored and demand limited. Only electricity meters are currently allowed.
Field: Demand Limit Schedule Name
The reference to the schedule object specifying the target demand limits [schedule values should be in Watts].
Field: Demand Limit Safety Fraction
This field is a multiplier that is applied to the target demand limit (above). When the metered demand exceeds (target demand limit * safety fraction), the DemandManagers begin to limit the demand. This helps to ensure that the target limit is not exceeded.
Field: Billing Period Schedule Name
The reference to the schedule object that defines the monthly billing periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in theMonth Schedule Namefield of theUtilityCost:Tariffobject. If left blank, it defaults to the regular divisions between months.
Field: Peak Period Schedule Name
The reference to the schedule object that defines the peak/off-peak time-of-use periods. The peak demand during the peak period of the billing period typically determines the demand charge. This should reference the same schedule that is used in theTime of Use Period Schedule Namefield of theUtilityCost:Tariffobject. A value of 1 indicates the peak period; any other value is off-peak. If left blank, it defaults to always on the peak period. TheDemandManagerAssignmentListonly attempts to demand limit during peak periods.
Field: Demand Window Length
This field is similar to the field of the same name in theUtilityCost:Tariffobject. However, the user may not want to limit using the same demand window as the utility company. This field allows the user to input the number of minutes over which to calculate the current demand. The minutes are rounded to match the nearest multiple of time steps.
Field: Demand Manager Priority
This field indicates what logic should be used to activate the individual DemandManagers in the list.Sequentialtreats the list of DemandManagers as a sequential priority list, i.e., the first DemandManager in the list is activated first, then the second, etc., until the demand falls below the limit.Allactivates all demand managers to achieve the maximum demand reduction.
Field: Demand Manager <#> Type
The key word defining the type of DemandManager.
Field: Demand Manager <#> Name
The name of a DemandManager object defined elsewhere in the input file.
DemandManagers are listed by pairs of data items:Demand Manager TypeandDemand Manager Name. This object is extensible, so additional pairs of these last two fields can be added to the end of this object.
