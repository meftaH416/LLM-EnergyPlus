Equipment Types
In eachPlantEquipmentListdescribed using the above syntax, various equipment types and names must be given. Each type-name pair must then have a corresponding equipment definition. This subsection lists the various equipment types that are available and examples from an IDF. Where appropriate, notes and comments on the input structure are provided.
Generic Chiller Outputs
Many output variable names are common across all chiller types. These generic chiller output names all begin with the word “Chiller”. Certain chiller types have additional output variables which are specific to that type of chiller. Chiller energy use is added to the appropriate plant-level meters as a cooling end-use.

Chiller COP [W/W]
This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller during cooling operation. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate (Chiller Evaporator Cooling Rate) divided by the “fuel” consumption rate by the chiller. For the constant COP and electric chillers, the “fuel” is electricity so the divisor is Chiller Electricity Rate [W]. For the absorption chiller, the “fuel” is steam so the divisor is Steam Consumption Rate [W].
Note that this variable is reported as zero when the chiller is not operating. When reported for frequencies longer than “detailed” (such as timestep, hourly, daily, monthly or environment), this output will only be meaningful when the chiller is operating for the entire reporting period. To determine an average COP for a longer time period, compute the COP based on total evaporator heat transfer divided by total electric or fuel input over the desired period.
Chiller Part Load Ratio
This output is the operating part-load ratio of the indirect absorption chiller. This output may fall below the minimum part-load ratio specified in the input. For this case, the Chiller Cycling Ratio is used to further define the performance of the indirect absorption chiller.
Chiller Cycling Ratio
This output is the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates. When the chiller operates above the minimum part-load ratio, a Chiller Cycling Ratio of 1 is reported. When the chiller operates below the minimum part-load ratio, the Chiller Cycling Ratio reports the fraction of the timestep the indirect absorption chiller operates.

Field: Chilled Water Outlet Temperature Lower Limit
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the evaporator outlet temperature. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold.
Field: Generator Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Generator Inlet Node. A steam or hot water loop is not required to simulate an absorption chiller. If a steam/hot water loop is used, enter the name of the generator inlet node.
Field: Generator Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the Generator Outlet Node. A steam or hot water loop is not required to simulate an absorption chiller. If a steam/hot water loop is used, enter the name of the generator outlet node.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint at the evaporator outlet.  For this absorption chiller, this mode also affects the flow rate on the generator connection.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.  This flow mode does not impact the condenser loop connection.
Field: Generator Fluid Type
This choice field specifies the type of fluid used to heat the generator solution. The valid choices areHotWaterorSteam. This field should be specified as Steam or left blank if the generator inlet/outlet nodes are not specified.
Field: Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the absorption chiller's design condenser fluid flow rate in cubic meters per second.
Field: Degree of Subcooling in Steam Generator
Ideally, the steam trap located at the outlet of the generator should remove all the condensate immediately, however, there is a delay in this process in actual systems which causes the condensate to SubCool by a certain amount before leaving the generator. This amount of subcooling is included in the heat transferred to the solution in the generator. The minimum value is 0º Celsius and default is 5º Celsius. This field is not used when the generator inlet/outlet node are not specified or the generator is connected to a hot water loop.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Nominal Pumping Power, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate, Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Design Generator Fluid Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

Chiller:Absorption:Indirect
TheChiller:Absorption:Indirectobject is an enhanced version of the absorption chiller model found in theBuildingLoads and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) program. This enhanced model is nearly identical to the existing absorption chiller model (Ref.Chiller:Absorption)with the exceptions that: 1) the enhanced indirect absorption chiller model provides more flexible performance curves and 2) chiller performance now includes the impact of varying evaporator, condenser, and generator temperatures. Since these absorption chiller models are nearly identical (i.e., the performance curves of the enhanced model can be manipulated to produce similar results to the previous model), it is quite probable that theChiller:Absorptionmodel will be deprecated in a future release of EnergyPlus.

Chiller:ConstantCOP
This chiller model is based on a simple, constant COP simulation of the chiller. In this case, performance does not vary with chilled water temperature or condenser conditions.
Such a model is useful when the user does not have access to detailed performance data.
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller.
Field: Nominal Capacity
This numeric field contains the nominal cooling capability of the chiller in Watts.
Field: Nominal COP
This numeric field contains the Chiller's coefficient of performance.
Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate
For variable volume chiller this is the maximum flow and for constant flow chiller this is the design flow rate. The units are in cubic meters per second.
Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the electric chiller's design condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field is autosizable. This field is not used for Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled.
Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller plant side inlet node.
Field: Chilled Water Outlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller plant side outlet node.
Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in anOutdoorAir:Nodeobject where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in anOutdoorAir:NodeListobject where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).
Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the constant COP chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.
Field: Condenser Type
This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. The 3 type of condensers are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being AirCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require aCondenserLoopto be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of theCondenserLoopand its associated equipment.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.

This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.

The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction
This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluids.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Process”. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.

Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node.
Field: Condenser Maximum Requested Flow Rate
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.

Chiller:Electric:EIR
This chiller model is the empirical model used in the DOE-2.1 building energy simulation program. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves for more than 160 chillers, including the default DOE-2.1E reciprocating and centrifugal chillers, are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf).
Note:Chiller:Electric:EIRobjects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should normally be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with caution.
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the electric EIR chiller.
Field: Reference Capacity
This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.
Field: Reference COP
This numeric field contains the chiller's coefficient of performance. This value shouldnotinclude energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. This valueshouldinclude evap-cooled or air-cooled condenser fans except when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field defined below is used and that input value is greater than 0. For the case when condenser fan power is modeled separately, the calculated condenser fan energy is reported on the same electric meter as compressor power. Be careful to not duplicate this energy use.
Field: Reference Leaving Chilled Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 6.67C.
Field: Reference Entering Condenser Fluid Temperature
This numeric field contains the chiller's reference entering condenser fluid temperature in Celsius. The default value is 29.4C. For water-cooled chillers this is the water temperature entering the condenser (e.g., leaving the cooling tower). For air- or evap-cooled condensers this is the entering outdoor air dry-bulb or wet-bulb temperature, respectively.
Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate
For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller's evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.
Field: Reference Condenser Fluid Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the chiller's operating condenser fluid flow rate in cubic meters per second. This field can be autosized. This field is also used to enter the air flow rate if Condenser Type = AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and Heat Recovery is specified. If AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is autosized, the air flow rate is set to 0.000114 m3/s/W (850 cfm/ton) multiplied by the chiller Reference Capacity. For air- and evaporatively-cooled condensers, this flow rate is used to set condenser outlet air node conditions and used for evaporatively-cooled condensers to calculate water use rate.
Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Note: The curve is evaluated at the leaving chilled water (=evaporator outlet)setpointtemperature, not theactualleaving chilled water temperature.
Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the entering condenser fluid temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name
The name of a quadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The quadratic curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.
Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.
Field: Chilled Water Inlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.
Field: Chilled Water Outlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.
Field: Condenser Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and a condenser inlet node name is specified here, the node name specified must also be specified in anOutdoorAir:Nodeobject where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor air temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name may be specified in anOutdoorAir:NodeListobject where the outdoor air temperature is taken directly from the weather data. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates an outdoor air node and the air temperature information on this node is taken directly from the weather file (no node height adjustment).
Field: Condenser Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node. This node name is required if the chiller is WaterCooled, and optional if the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled. If the chiller is AirCooled or EvaporativelyCooled and this field is left blank, the program automatically creates a condenser side outlet air node.
Field: Condenser Type
This alpha field determines what type of condenser will be modeled with this chiller. Valid condenser types are AirCooled, WaterCooled, and EvaporativelyCooled with the default being WaterCooled if not specified. AirCooled and EvaporativelyCooled do not require a Condenser Loop to be specified, whereas the WaterCooled option requires the full specification of the Condenser Loop and its associated equipment.
Field: Condenser Fan Power Ratio
This field is used to model condenser fan power associated with air-cooled or evaporatively-cooled condensers (for cooling towers, refer to Group - Condenser Equipment). Enter the ratio of the condenser fan power to the reference chiller cooling capacity in W/W. If this input is greater than 0, the condenser fan power is modeled seperatly from compressor power. In addition, if condenser fan power is modeled using this input, the reference COP and “Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of” performance curves should not include condenser fan power.
Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser
This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.
Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the fluid doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2C.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate
This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or Autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below. Note that heat recovery is only available with Condenser Type = WaterCooled.
Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.
Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: Basin Heater Capacity
This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction
This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Process”. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.

Most of these chiller output variables are defined above under “Generic Chiller Outputs.”  Output variables not described above are discussed here.
Chiller Condenser Fan Electricity Rate  [W]
Chiller Condenser Fan Electricity Energy  [J]
These outputs are for the electric power consumption of the chiller condenser fan and are applicable to air- or evaporatively-cooled chillers. These reports are available only for theChiller:Electric:EIRand only when the Condenser Fan Power Ratio input field is greater than 0. This output is also added to a meter object with Resource Type = Electricity, End Use Key = Chillers, Group Key = Plant (Ref.Output:Meterobjects).
Chiller Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier []
This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.
Chiller EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier []
This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.
Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier []
This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Curve.
Chiller Part Load Ratio []
This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller capacity. This value is used to determine Chiller EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier.
Chiller Cycling Ratio []
The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller operates during each simulation timestep. If the chiller part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller cycles on and off to meet the cooling load.
Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Rate [W]
Chiller False Load Heat Transfer Energy [J]
These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller. When the chiller part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity. The false load heat transfer output variable is not metered.
Chiller Evaporative Condenser Water Volume [m3]
Chiller Evaporative Condenser Mains Supply Water Volume [m3]
These outputs are the water use for evaporatively-cooled condensers. When the chiller operates, the water consumed by the evaporatively-cooled condenser is proportional to the chiller condenser heat transfer. The evaporative condenser is assumed to be 100% effective where the condenser inlet air dry-bulb temperature is equal to the outdoor wet-bulb temperature.
Chiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIR
This chiller model, developed through the CoolToolsTMproject sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), is an empirical model similar to EnergyPlus'Chiller:Electric:EIRmodel. The model uses performance information at reference conditions along with three curve fits for cooling capacity and efficiency to determine chiller operation at off-reference conditions. The model has the same capabilities as theChiller:Electric:EIRmodel, but can potentially provide significant accuracy improvement over theChiller:Electric:EIRmodel for variable-speed compressor drive and variable condenser water flow applications. Chiller performance curves can be generated by fitting manufacturer's catalog data or measured data. Performance curves developed from manufacturer's performance data are provided in the EnergyPlus Reference DataSets (Chillers.idf and AllDataSets.idf). This chiller model can be used to predict the performance of various chiller types (e.g., reciprocating, screw, scroll, and centrifugal) with water-cooled condensers.
The main difference between this model and theChiller:Electric:EIRmodel is the condenser fluid temperature used in the associated performance curves: theChiller:Electric:ReformulatedEIRmodel uses the LEAVING condenser water temperature while theChiller:Electric:EIRmodel uses the ENTERING condenser water temperature.
Note: Chiller:Electric:Reformulated EIR objects and their associated performance curve objects are developed using performance information for a specific chiller and should almost always be used together for an EnergyPlus simulation. Changing the object input values, or swapping performance curves between chillers, should be done with extreme caution. For example, if the user wishes to model a chiller size that is different from the reference capacity, it is highly recommended that the reference flow rates be scaled proportionately to the change in reference capacity. Although this model can provide more accurate prediction than theChiller:Electric:EIRmodel, it requires more performance data to develop the associated performance curves (at least 12 points from full-load performance and 7 points from part-load performance).
Inputs
Field: Chiller Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for this chiller.
Field: Reference Capacity
This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the chiller in Watts. This should be the capacity of the chiller at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below. Alternately, this field can be autosized.
Field: Reference COP
This numeric field contains the chiller's coefficient of performance. This value shouldnotinclude energy use due to pumps or cooling tower fans. This COP should be at the reference temperatures and water flow rates defined below.

Field: Reference Leaving Condenser Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the chiller's reference leaving condenser water temperature in Celsius. The default value is 35C.
Field: Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate
For a variable flow chiller this is the maximum water flow rate and for a constant flow chiller this is the operating water flow rate through the chiller's evaporator. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.
Field: Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the chiller's operating condenser water flow rate in cubic meters per second. The units are in cubic meters per second. The minimum value for this numeric input field must be greater than zero, or this field can be autosized.
Field: Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name
The name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the cooling capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
The name of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve. Valid curve object types areCurve:QuadraticorTable:Lookup.The performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve or theTable:Lookupshould be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type
This choice field determines which type of the Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve is used in the chiller modeling. Two curve types are available: (1) Type LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature is based on the leaving condenser water temperature. (2) Type Lift is based on the normalized lift, which is the temperature difference between the leaving condenser water temperature and the leaving evaporator water temperature.
Field: Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name
The name of performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving condenser water temperature and the part-load ratio (EIRfTPLR). The form of this curve is based on the input for Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Type.
For the type of LeavingCondenserWaterTemperature, the curve object type should beCurve:BicubicorTable:Lookupthat parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and the leaving condenser water temperature.
For the type of Lift, the curve object type should beCurve:ChillerPartLoadWithLiftorTable:Lookupthat parameterizes the variation of EIR as a function of the normalized fractional Lift, normalized Tdev and the PLR. Tdev is the difference between Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Chilled Water Temperature. Lift is the difference between the Leaving Condenser Water Temperature and Leaving Chilled Water Temperature. The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the chiller's available cooling capacity. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. The output of this curve is multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the Energy Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference leaving condenser water temperature with the part-load ratio equal to 1.0. An ideal chiller with the same efficiency at all part-load ratio's would use a performance curve that has a value of 0 when the part-load ratio equals 0 (i.;e., a line connecting 0,0 and 1,1 when plotted as EIRfTPLR versus PLR), however, actual systems can have part-load EIR's slightly above or below this line (i.e., part-load efficiency often differs from rated efficiency). The bicubic curve should be valid for the range of condenser water temperatures and part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation (otherwise the program issues warning messages).
Note: Although a bicubic curve requires 10 coefficients (ref.Curve:Bicubic),coefficients 7, 9 and 10 are typically not used in the performance curve described here and should be entered as 0 unless sufficient performance data and regression accuracy exist to justify the use of these coefficients. Additionally, coefficients 2, 3, and 6 should not be used unless sufficient temperature data is available to accurately define the performance curve (i.e., negative values may result from insufficient data).
Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum part-load ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. Below this part-load ratio, the compressor cycles on and off to meet the cooling load. The Minimum Part Load Ratio must be less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.1.
Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's maximum part-load ratio. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.0. The Maximum Part Load Ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Minimum Unloading Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller's minimum unloading ratio. The expected range is between 0 and 1. The minimum unloading ratio is where the chiller capacity can no longer be reduced by unloading and must be false loaded to meet smaller cooling loads. A typical false loading strategy is hot-gas bypass. The minimum unloading ratio must be greater than or equal to the Minimum Part Load Ratio, and less than or equal to the Maximum Part Load Ratio. The default value is 0.2.
Field: Chilled Water Side Inlet Node
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) inlet node.
Field: Chilled Water Side Outlet Node
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller plant side (chilled water) outlet node.
Field: Condenser Side Inlet Node
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side inlet node.
Field: Condenser Side Outlet Node
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller condenser side outlet node.
Field: Fraction of Compressor Electric Power Rejected by Condenser
This numeric input represents the fraction of compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. Enter a value of 1.0 when modeling hermetic chillers. For open chillers, enter the compressor motor efficiency. This value must be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, with a default value of 1.0.
Field: Leaving Chilled Water Lower Temperature Limit
This numeric field contains the lower limit for the leaving chilled water temperature in Celsius. This temperature acts as a cut off for heat transfer in the evaporator, so that the water doesn't get too cold. This input field is currently unused. The default value is 2C.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode Type
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Design Heat Recovery Water Flow Rate
This is the design heat recovery water flow rate if the heat recovery option is being simulated. If this value is greater than 0.0 (or autosize), a heat recovery loop must be specified and attached to the chiller using the next two node fields. The units are in cubic meters per second.  This field is autosizable.  When autosizing, the flow rate is simply the product of the design condenser flow rate and the condenser heat recovery relative capacity fraction set in the field below.
Field: Heat Recovery Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side inlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.
Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the chiller heat recovery side outlet node. If the user wants to model chiller heat recovery, a heat recovery loop must be specified and it can only be used with a water-cooled condenser.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Capacity, Reference Chilled Water Flow Rate and Reference Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction
This field is optional.  It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section.  This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller.  This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection.  If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
Field: Heat Recovery Inlet High Temperature Limit Schedule Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to control heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The schedule named here should contain temperature values, in C, that describe an upper limit for the return fluid temperatures entering the chiller at the heat recovery inlet node.  If the fluid temperature is too high, then the heat recovery will not operate.  This is useful to restrict the chiller lift from becoming too high and to avoid overheating the hot water loop.  This limit can be used with or without the alternate control using leaving setpoint that is set in the next field.
Field: Heat Recovery Leaving Temperature Setpoint Node Name
This field is optional.  It can be used to refine the model and controls for heat recovery operation of the chiller.  The node named here should have a setpoint placed on it by a setpoint manager.  If the plant loop's demand calculation scheme is set to SingleSetpoint, then a single setpoint manager should be used.  If the plant loop's demand calculation is set to DualSetpointDeadband then a dual setpoint manager should be used and the upper setpoint is used for control.  When this field is used, a different model is used for determining the distribution of rejected heat between the two bundles that is more appropriate for series bundle arrangements and for chiller's that are able to produce relatively higher temperature heated fluilds.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Process”. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the chiller will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.

This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side inlet node. If a loop is connected, then the jacket and lubricant heat will be recovered. There is no need for an effectiveness term, since the jacket and lubricant recovered heat energies are the actual recovered energies.
Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet node.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Maximum Temperature for Heat Recovery at Heat Recovery Outlet Node
This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery. The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit. This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller. For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field. The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting. This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply. The temperature is specified in degrees C.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: Basin Heater Capacity
This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction
This field is optional. It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section. This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller. This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection. If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.

Field: Heat Recovery Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the heat recovery side outlet.
Field: Chiller Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the chiller operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device's evaporator.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the chiller's request for flow is stricter and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the chiller model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the chiller matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the chiller - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.  The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Fuel Type
This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. Valid choices are:NaturalGas, Propane, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, OtherFuel1orOtherFuel2. The default isNaturalGas.
Field: Heat Recovery Maximum Temperature
This field sets the maximum temperature that this piece of equipment can produce for heat recovery.  The idea behind this field is that the current models do not take temperatures into account for availability and they just pass Q's around the loop without a temperature limit.  This temperature limit puts an upper bound on the recovered heat and limits the max temperatures leaving the component.
As temperatures in the loop approach the maximum temperature, the temperature difference between the entering water and the surfaces in the piece of equipment becomes smaller.  For the given heat recovery flow rate and that temperature difference the amount of heat recovered will be reduced, and eventually there will be no heat recovered when the entering water temperature is equal to the maximum temperature specified by the user in this field.  The reduced amount of heat recovered will diminish if the temperature of the loop approach is the maximum temperature, and this will show up in the reporting.  This allows the user to set the availability or the quality of the heat recovered for usage in other parts of the system or to heat domestic hot water supply.
The temperature is specified in degrees C.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity, Design Chilled Water Flow Rate and Design Condenser Water Flow Rate. Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: Basin Heater Capacity
This numeric field contains the capacity of the chiller's electric basin heater in watts per degree Kelvin. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. This field is used in conjunction with the Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature described in the following field. The basin heater electric power is equal to this field multiplied by the difference between the basin heater set point temperature and the outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The basin heater only operates when the chiller is off, regardless of the basin heater schedule described below. The basin heater capacity must be greater than or equal to zero, with a default value of zero if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Setpoint Temperature
This numeric field contains the set point temperature (˚C) for the basin heater described in the previous field. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater is active when the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature falls below this setpoint temperature, as long as the chiller is off. This set point temperature must be greater than or equal to 2˚C, and the default value is 2˚C if this field is left blank.
Field: Basin Heater Operating Schedule Name
This alpha field contains the name of the basin heater operating schedule. This field only applies for Condenser Type = EvaporativelyCooled. The basin heater operating schedule is assumed to be an on/off schedule and the heater is available to operate any time the schedule value is greater than 0. The basin heater operates when scheduled on and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature is below the set point temperature described in the previous field. If this field is left blank, the basin heater is available to operate throughout the simulation. Regardless of this schedule, the basin heater may only operate when the chiller is off.
Field: Condenser Heat Recovery Relative Capacity Fraction
This field is optional. It can be used to describe the physical size of the heat recovery portion of a split bundle condenser section. This fraction describes the relative capacity of the heat recovery bundle of a split condenser compared to the nominal, full load heat rejection rate of the chiller. This fraction will be applied to the full heat rejection when operating at nominal capacity and nominal COP to model a capacity limit for the heat rejection. If this field is not entered then the capacity fraction is set to 1.0.
Field: Turbine Engine Efficiency
This field is optional. It can be used to scale the size of Gas Turbine Engine Capacity. the default is 0.35.

ChillerHeater:Absorption:DirectFired
This chiller is a direct fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the equivalent chiller in DOE-2.1E. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

When the chiller is operating as only a heater, the  curve is used to represent the fraction of fuel used as the heating load varies. It is normalized so that a value of 1.0 is the full available heating capacity. The curve is usually linear or quadratic and will probably be similar to a boiler curve for most chillers.

Field: Temperature Curve Input Variable

This chiller is an exhaust fired absorption chiller-heater which is modeled using performance curves similar to the direct fired absorption chiller in DOE-2.1E. The model uses the exhaust gas output from MicroTurbine. This type of chiller is unusual for EnergyPlus, because it may be used in the same plant on both a chilled water supply branch and a hot water supply branch. The chiller has six node connections for chilled water, condenser water, and hot water, and can provide simultaneous heating and cooling. During simultaneous operation, the heating capacity is reduced as the cooling load increases (for more details see below). Some equations are provided below to help explain the function of the various performance curves. For a detailed description of the algorithm and how the curves are used in the calculations, please see the Engineering Reference.

Boiler:HotWater
The boiler model calculates the performance of fuel oil, gas and electric boilers. Boiler performance is based on nominal thermal efficiency. A normailized efficiency performance curve may be used to more accurately represent the performance of non-electric boilers but is not considered a required input. When using the normalized efficiency performance curve, if all coefficients are not required simply set the unused coefficients to 0. For example, an electric boiler could be modeled by setting the nominal thermal efficiency to a value in the range of 0.96 to 1.0. Coefficient A0 in the normalized efficiency performance curve would equal 1 and all other coefficients would be set to 0. Coefficients for other types of non-electric boilers would set a combination of the available coefficents to non-zero values.
Inputs
Field: Name
This required alpha field contains the identifying name for the boiler.
Field: Fuel Type
This required choice field specifies the type of fuel used by the boiler. The fuel type can beElectricity, NaturalGas, Propane, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, Coal, Diesel, Gasoline, OtherFuel1orOtherFuel2.
Field: Nominal capacity
This numeric field contains the nominal operating capacity (W) of the boiler. The boiler may be autosized and would require a heating plant sizing object.
Fuel Use Equation
The model is based the following two equations:


Field: Nominal Thermal Efficiency
This required numeric field contains the heating efficiency (as a fraction between 0 and 1) of the boiler's burner.  This is the efficiency relative to the higher heating value (HHV) of fuel at a part load ratio of 1.0. Manufacturers typically specify the efficiency of a boiler using the higher heating value of the fuel. For the rare occurences when a manufacturers (or particular data set) thermal efficiency is based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel, multiply the thermal efficiency by the lower-to-higher heating value ratio. For example, assume a fuel's lower and higher heating values are approximately 45,450 and 50,000 kJ/kg, respectively. For a manuracturers thermal effiency rating of 0.90 (based on the LHV), the nominal thermal efficiency entered here is 0.82 (i.e. 0.9 multiplied by 45,450/50,000).
Field: Efficiency Curve Temperature Evaluation Variable
This field is used to control which value for hot water temperature is used when evaluating the efficiency curve specified in the next field (if applicable).  There are two options,  EnteringBoiler or LeavingBoiler.  EnteringBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at boiler inlet node.  LeavingBoiler indicates that the efficiency curves will be evaluated using the temperature at the boiler outlet.  This field is only used if type of curve is one that uses temperature as a independent variable.
Field: Normalized Boiler Efficiency Curve Name
This alpha field contains the curve name which describes the normalized heating efficiency (as a fraction of nominal thermal efficiency) of the boiler's burner. If this field is left blank, the nominal thermal efficiency is assumed to be constant (i.e., Fuel Used is equal to the Theoretical Fuel Use in the equation above). When a boiler efficiency curve is used, the curve may be any valid curve object with 1 (PLR) or 2 (PLR and boiler outlet water temperature) independent variables. A tri-quadratic curve object is not allowed since it uses 3 independent variables. The linear, quadratic, and cubic curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is solely a function of boiler part-load ratio (PLR). When this type of curve is used, the boiler should operate at (or very near) the design boiler water outlet temperature. Other curve types may be used when the boiler efficiency is a function of both PLR and boiler water temperature. Examples of valid single and dual independent variable equations are shown below. For all curve types PLR is always the x independent variable. When using 2 independent variables, the boiler outlet water temperature (Toutlet) is always the y independent variable.

Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the maximum part load ratio. If the ratio of demand to boiler nominal capacity is greater than the maximum part load ratio, then the Max PLR will determine the operating PLR. This value may exceed 1, but the normal range is between 0 and 1.1. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.
Field: Optimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the optimum part load ratio. This is the part load ratio at which the boiler performs at its maximum efficiency. If this field is left blank, the default value is 1.0.
Field: Boiler Water Inlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the water inlet node name.
Field: Boiler Water Outlet Node Name
This required alpha field contains the water outlet node name.
Field: Water Outlet Upper Temperature Limit
This numeric field contains the outlet temperature upper limit. If this field is left blank, the default value is 99.9ºC.
Field: Boiler Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the boiler operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device.  There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior:  “NotModulated,” “ConstantFlow,” and “LeavingSetpointModulated.”  NotModulated is useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.  ConstantFlow is useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler's request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow.  LeavingSetpointModulated changes the boiler model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the boiler matches a setpoint.  In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the boiler - for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met.   The default, if not specified, is NotModulated.
Field: Parasitic Electric Load
This optional numeric field contains the parasitic electric power (W) consumed by a forced draft fan or other electrical device associated with the boiler. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the boiler is operating, and the model assumes that this parasitic power does not contribute to heating the water. The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if the field is left blank.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity and Design Water Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This optional field allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Process”. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Any text may be used here to further subcategorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the boiler will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.

Plant Loop Heat Pumps
EnergyPlus has four plant loop heat pump models: parameter estimation (water-source only), equation fit (water-source only), EIR-formulated (water or air source), and fuel-fired absorption (air-source only).
HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling
HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating
This model is an equation-fit model from the catalog data which resembles a black box with no usage of heat transfer equations. The performance of the heat pump is modeled using curves fitted from the catalog data.
HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Cooling
HeatPump:WaterToWater:ParameterEstimation:Heating
This model is a parameter estimation based model that uses physical parameters generated from the catalog data. The physical parameters are then used to predict the performance of the heat pump using thermodynamic laws and heat transfer equations. The heat pump has a reciprocating compressor that serves both the hot water and the chilled water loop. Note that this model is currently “hardwired” to fluid property R22. FluidProperties:* objects for R-22 must be included in the idf file. These may be copied from DataSetsFluidPropertiesRefData.idf.
Descriptions and strengths of these two models are available in the following references:

HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Cooling
HeatPump:PlantLoop:EIR:Heating
Beginning with version 9.1, an EIR-formulated heat pump model was added. This heat pump can be operated as a water-source object with the source-side connected to another plant loop, or as an air-source object with the source-side interacting with the outdoor air. This formulation allows the user to enter curves for specifying the capacity and energy usage in a more generic way, allowing the curves to be applicable to a wide variety of components. With the original equation fit model, the curve form was locked in to a specific set of linear coefficients. With the new form, the curve can be a quadratic function of temperatures, or an even more generic lookup table.
HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Cooling
HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heating
This is a fuel-fired air-to-water absorption cycle heat pump.
Configuration
The Supply side of the heat pump is usually connected to a Ground Heat Exchanger for a water-source object. The figure below shows the layout and piping diagram of the water-to-water heat pump.
Schematic of EnergyPlus Ground Loop Heat Exchanger[fig:schematic-of-energyplus-ground-loop-heat-001]
First, the equation fit model objects are described. This model has two sets of coefficients, one for the heating mode and other for the cooling mode.
HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Cooling
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the ground source heat pump.
Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's source side inlet node name.
Field: Source Side Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's source side outlet node name.
Field: Load Side Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's load side inlet node name.
Field: Load Side Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's load side outlet node name.
Field: Reference Load Side Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design volume flow rate on the load side of the heat pump in m3/s. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Source Side Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design volume flow rate on the source side of the heat pump in m3/s. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Cooling Capacity
This numeric field contains the design cooling capacity of the heat pump in W. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Cooling Power Consumption
This numeric field is the design electric power consumption for cooling, in W. This corresponds to the electic power use at the Reference Cooling Capacity. This field is autosizable. When autosized, the field called Reference Coefficient of Performance must be used.
Fields: Cooling Capacity Curve Name
This alpha field specifies the name of aquadlinearperformance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) for the Cooling Capacity curve. More details on how these coefficients in the curve are used are described in the Engineering Reference.
Field: Cooling Compressor Power Curve Name
This alpha field specifies the name of aquadlinearperformance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) for the Cooling Compressor Power curve. More details on how these coefficients in the curve are used are described in the Engineering Reference.
Field: Reference Coefficient of Performance
This field is required if the Reference Cooling Power Consumption is set to autosize. The nominal COP is defined by the Reference Cooling Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Cooling Power Consumption and is non-dimensional. This field is only used for sizing; if the Reference Power Consumption is set to a fixed value then the COP of the component during simulation will be determined by the ratio of Reference Cooling Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Cooling Power Consumption and not by the value in this field. This COP does not include power for fluid circulation pumps, it is just the heat pump itself.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Load Side Flow Rate, Reference Source Side Flow Rate, Reference Cooling Capacity, and Reference Cooling Power Consumption. The Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the plant loop's design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For example if there are two heat pumps on the supply side, each one could be sized to be half of the design load.
Field: Companion Heating Heat Pump Name
This optional name field allows the user to specify the companion heating water to water heat pump for this cooling component. This should be the name of anHeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heatingobject defined elsewhere in the input file. Because the cooling and heating models are often intended to represent separate operating modes of one single reversible heat pump, it is useful to identify the corresponding heating heat pump input object by name. This is currently used with autosizing so that the sizing calculations can be coordinated so that the two companion heat pumps get the same design reference flow rates.

HeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Heating
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the ground source heat pump.
Field: Source Side Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's source side inlet node name.
Field: Source Side Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's source side outlet node name.
Field: Load Side Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's load side inlet node name.
Field: Load Side Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the heat pump's load side outlet node name.
Field: Reference Load Side Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design volume flow rate on the load side of the heat pump in m3/s. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Source Side Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design volume flow rate on the source side of the heat pump in m3/s. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Heating Capacity
This numeric field contains the design heating capacity of the heat pump in W. This corresponds to the highest load side heat transfer rate listed in the catalog data. This field is autosizable.
Field: Reference Heating Power Consumption
This numeric field contains the design electric power consumption for heating, in W. This corresponds to the electic power use at the Reference Heating Capacity. This field is autosizable. When autosized, the field called Reference Coefficient of Performance must be used.
Fields: Heating Capacity Curve Name
This alpha field specifies the name of aquadlinearperformance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) for the Heating Capacity curve. More details on how these coefficients in the curve are used are described in the Engineering Reference.
Field: Heating Compressor Power Curve Name
This alpha field specifies the name of aquadlinearperformance curve object (ref: Performance Curves) for the Heating Compressor Power curve. More details on how these coefficients in the curve are used are described in the Engineering Reference.
Field: Reference Coefficient of Performance
This field is required if the Design Heating Power Consumption is set to autosize. The nominal COP is defined by the Reference Heating Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Heating Power Consumption and is non-dimensional. This field is only used for sizing; if the Reference Heating Power Consumption is set to a fixed value then the COP of the component during simulation will be determined by the ratio of Reference Heating Capacity divided by the corresponding Reference Heating Power Consumption and not by the value in this field.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Reference Load Side Flow Rate, Reference Source Side Flow Rate, Reference Heating Capacity, and Reference Heating Power Consumption. The Sizing Factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the plant loop's design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature. For example if there are two heat pumps on the supply side, each one could be sized to be half of the design load.
Field: Companion Cooling Heat Pump Name
This optional name field allows the user to specify the companion cooling water to water heat pump for this heating component. This should be the name of anHeatPump:WaterToWater:EquationFit:Coolingobject defined elsewhere in the input file. Because the cooling and heating models are often intended to represent separate operating modes of one single reversible heat pump, it is useful to identify the corresponding cooling heat pump input object by name. This is currently used with autosizing so that the sizing calculations can be coordinated so that the two companion heat pumps get the same design reference flow rates.

HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heating (and Cooling)
HeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingis a gas-fired (or fuel fired) air-to-water absorption heat pump that can be used for space heating and domestic hot water.
Inputs
TheHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingwill take the following input fields:
Field: Name
The name of the gas-fired (fuel-fired) absorption heat pump system.
Field: Water Inlet Node Name
The name of the water inlet node connection. For the heating mode, this will be likely the incoming DHW water node. For the cooling mode, this will be the chilled water inlet node.
Note that here the “water” does not have to be literally mean “water”. Rather it is the working fluid in the connected water side plant loop, which is can be some kind of glycol-water solution as well.
Field: Water Outlet Node Name
The name of the water outlet node connection. For the heating mode, this will be likely the supply DHW water node. For the cooling mode, this will be the supply chilled water outlet node.
Field: Air Source Node Name
The name of the air source node for the heat pump, for either the heating mode or the cooling mode. This should be an outdoor air node.
Field: Companion Cooling Heat Pump Name
This optional name field allows the user to specify the companion cooling water to water heat pump for this heating component. This should be the name of anHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject defined elsewhere in the input file. Because the cooling and heating models are often intended to represent separate operating modes of one single reversible heat pump, it is useful to identify the corresponding cooling heat pump input object by name. This is currently used with autosizing so that the sizing calculations can be coordinated so that the two companion heat pumps get the same design reference flow rates.
ForHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, this field name will be “Companion Heating Heat Pump Name” instead.
Field: Fuel Type
This alpha field determines the type of fuel that the chiller uses. The default is NaturalGas. Valid values are NaturalGas, Propane, Diesel, Gasoline, FuelOilNo1, FuelOilNo2, OtherFuel1, OtherFuel2.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This the end-use subcategory of the fuel usage.
Field: Nominal Heating Capacity
The nominal heating capacity in [W].
For theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, this field name is “Nominal Cooling Capacity”.
Field: Nominal COP
The nominal COP (Coefficient of Performance) in [W/W], which is the fuel based COP of the heat pump in the rating conditions. This is a require-field. The default value is set to 1.0 in case the input filed is accidently left blank.
For theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject, this is the fuel based nominal heatinging COP; and for theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, this is the fuel based nominal cooling COP.
Field: Design Flow Rate
The volumetric design flow rate of the water side in [m3/s].
Field: Design Supply Temperature
The design supply temperature on the water side in degree [C]. For theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject, the default value is 60C. For theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, the default value is 7.0C.
Field: Design Temperature Lift
The design temperature difference between the outlet water node and the inlet water node, in degree [C]. The default value is 11.1C. For theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject, this is a temperature rise; and forHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, this is a temperature drop.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The sizing factor is used when the component design inputs are autosized: the autosizing calculations are performed as usual and the results are multiplied by the sizing factor. For this component the inputs that would be altered by the sizing factor are: Nominal Capacity and Design Flow Rate. Sizing factor allows the user to size a component to meet part of the design load while continuing to use the autosizing feature.
Field: Flow Mode
This choice field determines how the gas-fired absorption heat pump operates with respect to the intended fluid flow through the device. There are three different choices for specifying operating modes for the intended flow behavior: “NotModulated”, “ConstantFlow”, and “LeavingSetpointModulated”.NotModulatedis useful for either variable or constant speed pumping arrangements where the boiler is passive in the sense that although it makes a nominal request for its design flow rate it can operate at varying flow rates.ConstantFlowis useful for constant speed pumping arrangements where the heat pump's request for flow is more strict and can increase the overall loop flow.LeavingSetpointModulatedchanges the heat pump model to internally vary the flow rate so that the temperature leaving the heat pump matches a setpoint. In all cases the operation of the external plant system can also impact the flow through the heat pump-for example if the relative sizes and operation are such that flow is restricted and the requests cannot be met. The default, if not specified, isNotModulated.
Field: Outdoor Air Temperature Curve Input Variable
This field sets the first independent variable in the three temperature dependent performance curves to either the outdoor air drybulb or wetbulb temperature. Manufacturers express the performance of their heat pumps using either the outdoor air drybulb temperature or the outdoor air wetbulb air temperature. Valid choices for this field are: “Drybulb” or “Wetbulb”. It is important that the performance curves and this field are consistent with each other. The default isDrybulb.
Field: Water Temperature Curve Input Variable
This field sets the second independent variable in the three temperature dependent performance curves to either the leaving or entering condenser water temperature. Manufacturers express the performance of their heat pumps using either the leaving condenser water temperature or the entering condenser water temperature. Valid choices for this field are: “LeavingCondenser” or “EnteringCondenser”. It is important that the performance curves and this field are consistent with each other. The default isEnteringCondenser.
ForHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject, the choices for this field should be the “LeavingEvaporator” and “EnteringEvaporator”.
Field: Normalized Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name
This field is the curve name of the normalized capacity function of the two independent temperature variables. The maximum capacity is adjusted from the rated conditions, and represents what the actual capacity the heat pump can achieve under the outdoor air temperature (either drybulb or wetbuld depending on the previous input field choice), and the water temperature (either leaving condenser/evaporator or entering condenser/evaporator depending on the previous input field choice).
Field: Fuel Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve name
The field is curve name for the fuel energy input ratio as a function of the two independent temperature values (air and water). It is the ratio of fuel consumption rate compared to the actual heating/cooling rate of the heat pump.
Field: Fuel Energy Input Ratio Function of PLR Curve Name
The field is curve name for the fuel energy input ratio as a function of the Part Load Ratio (PLR). It is the ratio of fuel consumption rate compared to the actual heating/cooling rate of the heat pump.
Field: Minimum Part Load Ratio
A positive fraction that represents the minimum heating output possible when operated continually at partial load conditions divided by the available heating capacity at those same conditions. The default is 0.1.
Field: Maximum Part Load Ratio
A positive fraction that represents the maximum heating output possible when operated continually at rated temperature conditions divided by the available heating capacity at those same conditions. If greater than 1.0, the equipment is typically thought of as capable of being overloaded. The default is 1.0.
Field: Defrost Control Type
The defrost control type. There are two options for this input:Timed, orOnDemand. TheTimedoption will use a fraction of time per hour to account for the defrost action. TheOnDemandoption will work when the outdoor air temperature drops to a certain point. The default choice isOnDemand.
Currently, theTimedoption is to be used with an electric resistive defrost heater only (see Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity). theOnDemandoption is used with fuel resources and the defrost EIR curve is used for the fuel energy adjustment.
This field applies to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject only. It does not apply to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject.
Field: Fuel Energy Input Ratio Defrost Adjustment Curve name
This is a normalized curve that would adjust the fuel energy input ratio taken into consideration of the defrost operation. The EIR (Energy Input Ratio) adjustment is a function of the outdoor air temperature-the temperature that the condenser is exposed to.
This field applies to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject only. It does not apply to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject.
Field: Defrost Operation Time Fraction
The fraction of the defrost time to the total operation time. The value should be in between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). The default value is 0.0.
This field applies to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject only. It does not apply to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject.
Field: Resistive Defrost Heater Capacity
This numeric field defines the capacity of the resistive defrost heating element in Watts. This input field is used only when the selected defrost control is “Timed”. The value for this input field must be greater than or equal to 0.0. If the input field is left blank, the default value is 0.0.

Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-bulb Temperature for Defrost Operation
The maximum outdoor air dry-bulb temperature in degree Celsius that the defrost operation will be turned on. When the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature rises above this temperature, the will be no defrost operation. The maximum value for this value is 10C. The default value is 5C.
This field applies to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Heatingobject only. It does not apply to theHeatPump:AirToWater:FuelFired:Coolingobject.
Field: Auxiliary Electric Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
Auxiliary Electric EIRFT-Auxiliary Electric Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name, which is a biquadratic curve or a lookup table which accounts for system internal fans, pumps, and electronics.
Field: Auxiliary Electric Energy Input Ratio Function of PLR Curve Name

CentralHeatPumpSystem
This is a central geothermal application that contains one or more chiller-heaters centrally located in the building; the available chilled and/or hot water is then piped to the individual zones. Chiller-heaters used for this particular system can be of two types: 1) standard vapor-compression, non-reversible cycle chillers designed for heat recovery or 2) reversible-cycle, water-to-water heat pump chillers. Unlike a distributed ground source heat pump configuration where individual heat pumps are located in each zone, a centralized geothermal configuration has one or more chiller-heaters. Its function is to encapsulate the extra controls needed to turn individual chiller-heater modules on/off and whether they are to operate in cooling-only, heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode and whether to connect the source water to the evaporator or condenser side. A variety of control schemes can be designed by setting schedules for both zone control types and individual chiller-heaters schedules.
The fluid used in this central system is usually water, and there is no sharing of condenser or evaporator water between multiple machines. However, the control logic is such that the source water can be delivered to individual chiller-heaters depending on their operating mode, e.g., modules in simultaneous cooling-heating mode receive no source water, modules in heating-only mode can have source water directed to their evaporator, or modules in cooling-only mode can have source water directed to their condenser; the decision on which module(s) receives the source water dictated by the ‘smart' controls. The following figures illustrate node interconnections between this central geothermal application and plant and condenser loops in various situations.
The order of the multiple chiller-heaters' operation is assumed to be sequential. In other words, the very first chiller-heater will be called at first to see if it meets all loads that the central heat pump system should meet. If the chiller-heater meets all loads, the rest chiller-heaters are assumed to be turned off. If not, the following chiller-heater will be called to meet the remaining loads until all loads are met in the order as defined in the set of individual chiller-heater objects below. The order of individual chiller-heater modules needs to be carefully arranged in case users are intended to see the performance of various combinations of different sizes of chiller-heaters in a central heat pump system.
Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode (Condensers reject heat to the ground source loop)[fig:diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with]
Diagram of a central heat pump system with three chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode (No heat is exchanged with the ground source loop)[fig:diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-001]
Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode[fig:diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-002]
In the above example, the cooling load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the heating load needs 1 chiller heater. Chiller 1 is in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chillers 2 and 3 are in cooling-only mode, their condensers rejecting heat to the ground source loop.
Diagram of a central heat pump system with two chiller-heaters in heat recovery mode and one chiller-heater in heating-only mode[fig:diagram-of-a-central-heat-pump-system-with-003]
In the above example, the heating load needs 3 chiller-heaters and the cooling load needs two chiller-heaters. Chillers 1 and 2 are in heat recovery mode and isolated from the ground source loop while chiller 3 is in heating-only mode, its evaporator extracting heat from the ground source loop.
Users are required to define three different nodes such as chilled water, hot water, and source water nodes. Only this central heat pump system will be metered, and individual chiller-heaters' energy will be available for reporting only, but not metered.

In other words, a central heat pump system must include at least one chiller-heater module component. A set of the following four fields helps to define the specific type of a chiller-heater module, its operation control, and the number of identical chiller-heater module objects.

ChillerHeaterPerformance:Electric:EIR
The performance of the chiller-heater will be defined by two sets of curves meant to describe unloading for: 1) cooling-only mode, and 2) heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Reference conditions must be defined for both because each has its own set of three unloading curves based on their associated reference conditions. The cooling-mode curves are typically (but not always) based on condenser entering water temperature while the heating-only mode curves are typically based on condenser leaving water temperature. This chiller-heater object allows the user to specify whether to use condenser leaving or condenser entering as a dependent variable to differentiate, if necessary, the condenser temperature basis used to generate the cooling- and heating-only mode curves.
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name of the chiller-heater to be included in a central heat pump system.
Field: Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity
This numeric field contains the reference cooling capacity of the evaporator in cooling mode in Watts. This value should be based on the reference temperatures and design water flow rates defined below. This field can be autosized.
Field: Reference Cooling Mode COP
This numeric field contains the reference coefficient of performance of the evaporator for cooling. It must be based on the values of Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature and Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature defined in the next two fields.
Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator for cooling in Celsius. The default value is 6.67C.
Field: Reference Cooling Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 29.4C.
Field: Reference Cooling Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference leaving condenser water temperature of the condenser in the cooling mode in Celsius. The default value is 35.0C.
Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Ratio
This numeric field contains the evaporator's capacity during the reference heating-only or simultaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling capacity. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

where Tchw,l is the leaving chilled water temperature and Tcond,l is the leaving condenser water temperature representing the heating-mode and cooling-mode reference temperatures defined elsewhere in this object.
The default is 0.75. This field is used to determine evaporator capacity in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode, multiplying it by the value entered in the field of the Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity. Note that even when there is no cooling load, i.e., the machine is in heating-only mode, the evaporator must still run and extract heat from the source water. In heating-only mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) may  float depending on the evaporator water flow rate and the source water temperature. In simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving chilled water temperature (Tchw,l) does not float but is determined by the chilled water setpoint controls. For both heating-only and simultaneous cooling and heating mode, the leaving condenser temperature (Tcond,l) is determined by the hot water supply setpoint controls. This value of Tchw,l, combined with Tcond,l is plugged into the CAPFT and EIRFT curves to determine the off-rated heating-mode evaporator capacity and associated compressor power.
Field: Reference Heating Mode Cooling Power Ratio
This numeric field contains the compressor power during simultaneous cooling-heating mode as a ratio of reference cooling compressor power. For example, the ratio may be expressed as follows:

The default value is 1.5. This field is used to determine full load compressor power at the simultaneous cooling-heating mode's reference chilled water leaving and condenser water leaving temperatures. Note: In heating-only mode, the chilled water leaving temperature floats so the EIRFT curve is used to modify the simultaneouos cooling-heating full load compressor power value.
Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Chilled Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference leaving chilled water temperature of the evaporator in simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This is typically the same as the reference cooling mode value and is used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The leaving chilled water temperature for the chiller-heater is not allowed to fall below this value during the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode. The default value is 6.67C.
Field: Reference Heating Mode Leaving Condenser Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference leaving condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field is typically controlled to the design hot water supply temperature, and used to create the heating-only mode and simultaneous cooling-heating mode unloading curves. The default value is 60.0C.
Field: Reference Heating Mode Entering Condenser Water Temperature
This numeric field contains the reference entering condenser water temperature of the condenser in heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the upper limit of the source water temperature. The default value is 29.44C.
Field: Heating Mode Entering Chilled Water Temperature Low Limit
This numeric field contains the low limit of the entering chilled water temperature in heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode in Celsius. This field typically represents the lower limit of the source water temperature. If necessary, auxiliary heat will be activated to prevent source water temperature falling below the chilled water entering minimum. The default value is 12.2C.
Field: Chilled Water Flow Mode Type
This alpha field contains the chilled water flow control mode. Valid water flow mode includes constant flow and variable flow, and the default water flow mode is constant flow.
Field: Design Chilled Water Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design chilled water flow rate in m/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.
Field: Design Condenser Water Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design condenser water flow rate in m/s. The minimum value for this field must be greater than zero, and this field is autosizable.
Field: Design Hot Water Flow Rate
This numeric field contains the design hot water flow rate in m/s. The minimum value and default value for this field are zero, and this field is autosizable.
Field: Compressor Motor Efficiency
This numeric field contains the fraction of efficiency of the compressor electrical energy consumption that must be rejected by the condenser. This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, and the default value is 1.0.
Field: Condenser Type
This alpha field contains the type of condenser. WaterCooled is the only valid type, and it requires the full specification of the condenser loop and its associated equipment.
Field: Cooling Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable
This alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the cooling mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.
Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Cooling Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Cooling Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual cooling load divided by the available cooling capacity of the chiller-heater. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bi-cubic formulation is generally only valid when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Cooling Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller-heater's optimum part-load ratio. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Cooling Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.
Field: Heating Mode Temperature Curve Condenser Water Independent Variable
This alpha field determines whether the entering or leaving condenser water temperature is used in the heating mode unloading performance curves that follow. Valid variables include EnteringCondenser and LeavingCondenser, and the default variable is EnteringCondenser. The condenser temperature used for the cooling mode unloading performance curves will be dependent on this field input. For example, leaving condenser water temperature will be used when the LeavingCondenser is chosen, otherwise entering condenser water temperature.
Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the evaporator capacity in heating mode as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined in the previous field. This curve is used to evaluate the adjusted evaporator capacity during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This adjusted capacity is used as part of the cooling part-load calculation for the EIRFPLR curve. It is then multiplied by the reference evaporator capacity to give the cooling capacity at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the leaving chilled water temperature and either the entering condenser water temperature or the leaving condenser water temperature as defined by the user. The EIR is the inverse of the COP. It is then multiplied by the reference EIR (inverse of the reference COP) to give the EIR at specific temperature operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures different from the reference temperatures). The curve should have a value of 1.0 at the reference temperatures and flow rates specified above. The biquadratic curve should be valid for the range of water temperatures anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Heating Mode Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve Name
This alpha field contains the name of a performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy input to cooling output ratio (EIR) as a function of the part-load ratio (EIRFPLR). The EIR is the inverse of the COP, and the part-load ratio is the actual evaporator load divided by the available evaporator capacity of the chiller-heater at the reference heating and simultaneous cooling-heating mode temperatures. This curve is generated by dividing the operating electric input power by the available full-load capacity (do not divide by load) at the specific operating temperatures. The curve output should decrease from 1 towards 0 as part-load ratio decreases from 1 to 0. Note that the bicubic formulation below can only be used when the chiller-heater uses a variable speed compressor motor drive. It is also generally valid only when LeavingCondenser variable is chosen for the field of Cooling Mode Condenser Water Temperature Curve Input Variable whereas the quadratic curve can be used both choices, i.e., LeavingCondenser and EnteringCondenser. The output of this curve is then multiplied by the reference full-load EIR (inverse of the reference COP) and the EIRFT to give the EIR at the specific temperatures and part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater is operating. This curve should have a value of 1.0 when the part-load ratio equals 1.0. The curve should be valid for the range of part-load ratios anticipated for the simulation.
Field: Heating Mode Cooling Capacity Optimum Part Load Ratio
This numeric field contains the chiller-heater's optimum part-load ratio during heating-only mode or simultaneous cooling-heating mode. This is the part-load ratio at which the chiller-heater performs at its maximum COP. The optimum part-load ratio must be greater than or equal to the minimum part-load ratio, and less than or equal to the maximum part-load ratio. (Note: Both the minimum part-load ratio and maximum part-load ratio are taken from the Heating Mode EIRFPLR curve definition.) The default value is 1.0.
Field: Sizing Factor
This optional numeric field allows the user to specify a sizing factor for this component. The Sizing Factor is a multiplier on the design plant chilled water loop flow rate associated with the chiller-heaters parentCentralHeatPumpSystemobject. The chiller-heater's modified chilled water flow can then be used to autocalculate the Design Condenser Water Flow Rate and Reference Cooling Mode Evaporator Capacity values. In general, it is best to autosize all three fields or set fixed values for all three fields.

Note that much of these output variables are adapted from the definitions above under “Generic Chiller Outputs” and “Electric EIR Chiller Outputs.” The following outputs are repeated up to the maximum of individual chiller-heater module objects. The maximum number may be different from the number of object defined in this object when users define two or more identical chiller-heater modules for a single chiller heater object in the central heat pump system.
Chiller Heater Operation Mode Unit <x>
This output represents the operating mode of the chiller-heater module. Two single mode outputs and three simultaneous cooling-heating mode outputs are possible:
offcooling-only modeheating-only modeheat recovery modecooling dominant simultaneous cooling-heating modeheating dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode.
off
cooling-only mode
heating-only mode
heat recovery mode
cooling dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode
heating dominant simultaneous cooling-heating mode.
The first mode 0 is reported when the chiller-heater is turned off. The next two modes 2 and 3 are reported when the chiller-heater provides only either cooling or heating, respectively. The last three modes 3 to 5 indicate when the chiller-heater is in a simultaneous cooling-heating mode. Mode 3 indicates the chiller-heaters provides simultaneous cooling and heatingwithoutheat exchange with the ground source. Mode 4 denotes that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system provides both cooling and heating, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining cooling demand (see Figure4. Diagram of a central heat pump system with one chiller-heater in heat recovery mode and two chiller-heaters in cooling-only mode) Similarly, mode 5 indicates that at least one of the chiller-heater modules in the central heat pump system is in the heat recovery mode, and the chiller-heater is meeting remaining heating demand (see Figure5).
Note that the decision to operate individual chiller-heater modules is solely dependent on the chiller-heater schedule and loads. A fraction may appear in case the chiller-heater mode varies within a zone time step. In this particular case, users may define a detailed reporting frequency for this output variable.
Chiller Heater Part Load Ratio Unit <x>
This output is the ratio of the evaporator heat transfer rate plus the false load heat transfer rate (if applicable) to the available chiller-heater capacity. This value is used to determine ChillerEIRFPLR.
Chiller Heater Cycling Ratio Unit <x>
The cycling ratio is the amount of time the chiller-heater operates during each simulation time step. If the chiller-heater part-load ratio falls below the minimum part-load ratio, the chiller-heater cycles on and off to meet the loads.
Chiller Heater Cooling Electricity Rate Unit <x> [W]
Chiller Heater Cooling Electricity Energy Unit <x> [J]
These outputs are the cooling electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.
Chiller Heater Heating Electricity Rate Unit <x> [W]
Chiller Heater Heating Electricity Energy Unit <x> [J]
These outputs are the heating electric power consumption of the chiller-heater.
Chiller Heater Cooling Rate Unit <x> [W]
Chiller Heater Cooling Energy Unit <x> [J]
These outputs are the evaporator heat transfer which is the cooling delivered by the chiller-heater module.
Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Rate Unit <x> [W]
Chiller Heater False Load Heat Transfer Energy Unit <x> [J]
These outputs are the heat transfer rate and total heat transfer due to false loading of the chiller-heater. When the chiller-heater part-load ratio is below the minimum unloading ratio, the chiller-heater false loads (e.g. hot-gas bypass) to further reduce capacity.
Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Rate Unit <x> [C]
Chiller Heater Condenser Heat Transfer Energy Unit <x> [C]
These outputs are the heat transfer which is the heating delivered by the chiller-heater module in heating mode.
Chiller Heater Evaporator Inlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]
Chiller Heater Evaporator Outlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]
Chiller Heater Evaporator Mass Flow Rate Unit <x> [C]
These outputs are the evaporator water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the chilled water temperatures and flow rate in cooling mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in heating mode.
Chiller Heater Condenser Inlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]
Chiller Heater Condenser Outlet Temperature Unit <x> [C]
Chiller Heater Condenser Mass Flow Rate Unit <x> [C]
These outputs are the condenser water inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rate. Note that these represent the hot water temperatures and flow rate in heating mode or the source water temperature and flow rate in cooling mode.
Chiller Heater COP Unit <x> [C]
This output is the coefficient of performance for the chiller-heater. It is calculated as the evaporator heat transfer rate divided by the chiller-heater electric power.
Chiller Heater Capacity Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]
This is the output of the curve object Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve.
Chiller Heater EIR Temperature Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]
This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Temperature Curve.
Chiller Heater EIR Part Load Modifier Multiplier Unit <x> [C]
This is the output of the curve object Electric Input to Cooling Output Ratio Function of Part Load Ratio Curve.
