Group - Zone Forced Air Units
Schedules And Availability Manager
Regarding component schedules, the general rule is don't schedule any components except the supply fan and the corresponding availability manager(s). Beyond that, every component should always be available and let the controls determine what runs or doesn't run. If a component other than the supply fan is scheduled off, then it will remain off even if the night cycle manager turns on the system.
ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem
The simplest piece of zone equipment is theZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystemcomponent.ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystemis used in situations where the user wishes to study the performance of a building without modeling a full HVAC system. In such a case, the Ideal Loads Air System is usually the sole conditioning component: the user does not need to specify air loops, water loops, etc. All that is needed for the ideal system are zone controls, zone equipment configurations, and the ideal loads system component. The use of a return plenum is optional and will require use of theAirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenumobject.
This component can be operated with infinite or finite heating and cooling capacity. For either mode-infinite or limited capacity-the user can also specify on/off schedules for heating and cooling and outdoor air controls. There are also optional controls for dehumidification, humidification, economizer, and heat recovery. This component may be used in combination with other HVAC equipment serving the same zone.
This component can be thought of as an ideal unit that mixes air at the zone exhaust condition (or plenum outlet condition when a plenum is attached) with the specified amount of outdoor air and then adds or removes heat and moisture at 100% efficiency in order to produce a supply air stream at the specified conditions. The energy required to condition the supply air is metered and reported asDistrictHeatingandDistrictCooling.
Notes:The ideal loads system uses the zone return node or an optional zone exhaust node to extract air from the zone. When theAirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenumis used the inlet of the ideal loads system is connected to the plenum outlet air node while the outlet of the ideal loads system is connected to a zone inlet node. The node name connected between the zone exhaust air node and plenum inlet air node must match in theZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsandAirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenumobjects. Every zone served by an HVAC component must have a return air node, even though this node may not be connected to anything. If more than one ideals loads air systems are connected to the sameAirloopHVAC:ReturnPlenumthen one of the ideal loads air systems will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum outlet air node and the remaining ideal loads air systems connected to the same return plenum will connect to the ZoneHVAC:ReturnPlenum induced air outlet nodes.
The ideal loads system was significantly expanded in version 7.0 (October 2011). As part of this upgrade, any change in the moisture content of the supply air stream results in a latent cooling (dehumidification) or latent heating (humidification) load which is metered asDistrictCoolingandDistrictHeatingenergy consumption. Prior to version 7.0, when the ideal loads system was in heating mode, only the energy for sensible heating was metered. This results in significant changes in reported energy use compared to earlier versions, especially when using theConstantSupplyHumidityRatiooption for Humidification Control Type.
Older idf files which are transitioned to version 7.0 will automatically be set to use theConstantSupplyHumidityRatiooption for both dehumidification and humidification controls, because this is equivalent to the controls used in the older version of this system. However, the user should review all of the humidity control options and select the one which best reflects the goal of the simulation.

Ideal Loads Output Variable Overview
All of theZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystemloads and energy use are reported for Sensible Heating, Latent Heating, Total Heating, Sensible Cooling, Latent Cooling, and Total Cooling. To explain the relationship between the various outputs, Total Cooling Energy will be used. Note that the outdoor air load variables are only calculated when there is active heating or cooling (or humidification/dehumidification).
ZoneIdeal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energyis the district cooling energy consumed by the ideal loads system “cooling coil” to cool and dehumidify the supply air.
ZoneIdeal LoadsZoneTotal Cooling Energyis the total (sensible plus latent) cooling energy delivered to the zone. If there is no outdoor air, thenZoneIdeal Loads Supply Air Total Cooling Energy =ZoneIdeal LoadsZoneTotal Cooling Energy.

Zone Ideal Loads Hybrid Ventilation Available Status []
This is the availability status of the ideal loads object as set by the hybrid ventilation manager. Rules to determine the availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 and 1. These integers represent NoAction (0) and ForceOff (1). When the availability status is ForceOff, the unit is turned off regardless of its availability schedule. The other status flag i.e. NoAction does not control the unit and the controls of the unit turn it back on. Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.

ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil
What is a fan coil unit? Like many HVAC terms, “fan coil unit” is used rather loosely. Sometimes it is used for terminal units that would be better described as powered induction units. Carrier and others use the term for the room side of refrigerant-based split systems. Here we are modeling in-room forced-convection hydronic units. The hydronic heating coil may be replaced with an electric heating coil. Typically these units are small (200-1200 cfm) and self-contained. They are mostly used in exterior zones, usually in hotels, apartments, or offices. They may be connected to ducted outside air, or have a direct outside air vent, but they do not have outside air economizers. Units with outside air economizers are marketed (in the United States) as unit ventilators. Unit ventilators are typically bigger than fan coils and are widely used in classrooms or other applications where ventilation is a priority. If a zonal unit with an outside economizer is desired,ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilatorshould be used.
The heating or cooling output of the fan coil unit is controlled by varying the air flow rate, the water flow rate, or both. Air flow rate can be controlled by cycling the fan on/off or with a variable speed fan drive. The most common setup is a two or three speed fan with the speed selected by hand. The fan then cycles on/off to control heating / cooling output. The controls are often a wall mounted thermostat with hand selection of heating/cooling and fan speed (off/low/medium/high). These controls may also be mounted on the unit.
Carrier offers a retrofit VSD motor for fan coil units. It claims up to 45% energy savings from such a retrofit, as well as increased comfort and less noise compared to a cycling fan (fan coil fans are typically noisy and inefficient). Some other manufacturers are also offering units with VSD fans. Variable speed fans appear to offer an easy way to significantly increase the efficiency of what have typically been very inefficient units.
EnergyPlus provides 6 capacity control methods for this unit:
multi-speed cycling fan with constant water flow rateconstant speed continuous fan with variable water flow ratevariable-speed fan with constant water flow ratevariable-speed fan with variable water flow ratemulti-speed fan with cycling between speeds and constant water flow.fan speed control based on ASHRAE 90.1

constant speed continuous fan with variable water flow rate
variable-speed fan with constant water flow rate
variable-speed fan with variable water flow rate
multi-speed fan with cycling between speeds and constant water flow.
fan speed control based on ASHRAE 90.1
In EnergyPlus the fan coil units are modeled as compound components. That is, they are assembled from other components. Fan coils contain an outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The fan coil input simply requires the names of these four components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot (for hydronic heating coil only) and cold water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, and outlet air node names and the outdoor air mixer object name. The outdoor air mixer child object provides the outdoor air and relief air nodes names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node. The fan coil unit is connected to a hot water loop through its hot water coil or with no hot water loop when using an electric coil (demand side) and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.
Note that the type of fan component associated with the fan coil unit depends on the type of capacity control method chosen. ForConstantFanVariableFlowaFan:OnOfforFan:ConstantVolumeshould be used. ForCyclingFan, aFan:OnOffshould be used, forVariableFanVariableFloworVariableFanConstantFlowaFan:VariableVolume, forMultiSpeedFanaFan:OnOffshould be used, and forASHRAE90VariableFan, aFan:OnOfforFan:VariableVolumeshould be chosen.
Fan coil units can be 4-pipe or 2-pipe. For 4-pipe units there are 2 supply pipes and 2 return pipes. For 2-pipe units there is a single supply pipe and a single return pipe and the supply is switched between hot and chilled water depending on the season. EnergyPlus models 4-pipe units, but the 4-pipe model can be used to model 2-pipe units by using the coil availability schedules to make sure that either hot or chilled water is exclusively available. Fan coil units with hydronic heat can instead be modeled using an electric heating coil if desired (i.e., replace the hydronic heating coil with an electric heating coil).
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique user assigned name for an instance of a Fan Coil unit. Any reference to this Fan Coil unit by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the fan coil unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Capacity Control Method
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices areConstantFanVariableFlow,CyclingFan,VariableFanVariableFlow,VariableFanConstantFlow,MultiSpeedFan, orASHRAE90VariableFan. ForConstantFanVariableFlow, the fan speed is held constant to produce a fixed air flow rate whenever the unit is scheduled on. The hot water or chilled flow rate is varied so that the unit output matches the zone heating or cooling requirement. ForCyclingFan, the fan speed is chosen so that the unit capacity is greater than or equal to the heating / cooling load and the fan is cycled to match unit output with the load. ForVariableFanVariableFlowboth air and water flow rates are varied to match the load. ForVariableFanConstantFlow,the water flow rate is at full flow and the fan speed varies to meet the load. ForMultiSpeedFanthe water flow rate is at full flow when there is load or fully closed when there is no load and the supply air flow rate is varied by varying the fan speed in order to match the load. ForASHRAE90VariableFan, the fan air flow rate is reduced according to the low speed supply air flow ratio when the zone sensible load is less than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio. The water coil water flow rate, or the electric heating coil part-load ratio, is modulated to meet the zone load. If the zone sensible load is greater than the zone sensible load multiplied by the low speed supply air flow ratio, then the air and water flow rate is increased to meet the load. If the zone load is greater than the design sensible load, the fan air flow rate is maintained at the maximum value while the water flow rate is further increased to the maximum available while electric heating coils are maintained at the maximum output.
Note: when ASHRAE90VariableFan is selected, if the the Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling/Heating Mode inputs are not specified, the simulation must include zone sizing to calculate the zone design sensible cooling and heating load used to modulate the fan speed and, for water coils, the water flow rate or for electric heating coils, the part load ratio.
MultiSpeedFan:for a given load, the fan cycles between speeds when fan speed selected is higher than the minimum speed or the fan cycles on-off when the fan speed selected is the minimum and the fan operating schedule is cycling fan. When the fan is operating as a continuous fan, then the fan runs at minimum speed even when there is no load to meet. When the speed selected is higher than the minimum speed, then the fan cycles between consecutive speed regardless of the fan operating schedule type. The model selects at what fan speed to run depending on cooling or heating load.

The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This input field is the name of a schedule that controls fan operation. Schedule Name values of 0 denote cycling fan operation (fan cycles with heating or cooling coil). Schedule values greater than 0 denote constant fan operation (fan runs continually regardless of coil operation). The fan operating mode defaults to cycling fan operation if this field is left blank. This input field is currently used withMultiSpeedFancapacity control method only.

When the zone load is one-half the fan coil capacity, the fan will operate at the minimum speed. When these fields are not entered, a zone sizing simulation must be performed. Both the cooling and heating supply air temperature must be entered or blank in unison. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. A value of 0 (in both fields) will disregard these fields.

When the fan coil capacity is greater than the zone load, the fan speed will modulate down to the minimum fan speed, based on the Low Speed Supply Air Flow Ratio input field, and the water flow rate will also be reduced to maintain the zone thermostat set point temperature. When the zone load is one-half the fan coil capacity, the fan will operate at the minimum speed. When these fields are not entered, a zone sizing simulation must be performed. Both the cooling and heating supply air temperature must be entered or blank in unison. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable. A value of 0 (in both fields) will disregard these fields.

Fan Coil Heating Energy [J]
This field is the dry air heat addition of the fan coil unit to the zone it is serving in Joules over the timestep being reported. This is determined by outlet and zone air conditions, the mass flow rate through the unit, and the timestep.
Fan Coil Total Cooling Rate [W]
This field is the total (sensible and latent) heat extraction rate of the fan coil unit from the zone it is serving in Watts. This is determined by the outlet and zone conditions and the mass flow rate through the unit.
Fan Coil Total Cooling Energy [J]
This field is the total (sensible and latent)  heat extraction of the fan coil unit from the zone it is serving in Joules over the timestep being reported. This is determined by outlet and zone air conditions, the mass flow rate through the unit, and the timestep.
Fan Coil Sensible Cooling Rate [W]
This field reports the dry air sensible heat extraction rate of the fan coil unit from the zone it is serving in Watts. This is determined by the outlet and zone conditions and the mass flow rate through the unit.
Fan Coil Sensible Cooling Energy [J]
This field is the dry air sensible heat extraction of the fan coil unit from the zone it is serving in Joules over the timestep being reported. This is determined by the outlet and zone conditions, the mass flow rate through the unit, and the timestep.
Fan Coil Fan Electricity Rate [W]
This field reports the electricity consumption rate of the fan coil unit in Watts.
Fan Coil Fan Electricity Energy [J]
This field is the electricity consumption of the fan coil unit in Joules over the timestep being reported.
Fan Coil Runtime Fraction[]
This field is the fraction of the system timestep the fan coil unit is running for theCyclingFancapacity control method.  This variable is defined only for theCyclingFancapacity control method.
Fan Coil Fan Speed Level []
This field is indicates the speed chosen for the fan in theCyclingFanandMultiSpeedFancapacity control methods.  A value of ‘0' means that the unit is off, ‘1' the fan is running at its low speed, ‘2' medium speed, and ‘3' high speed (maximum). This variable is defined only for theCyclingFanandMultiSpeedFancapacity control methods.
Fan Coil Part Load Ratio []
When the capacity control method isVariableFanVariableFloworVariableFanConstantFlow,this output variable reports the unit part load ratio (ratio of unit heating / cooling output to the maximum heating / cooling output). This variable is defined only forVariableFanVariableFlow,VariableFanConstantFloworMultiSpeedFancapacity control methods. The unit part load ratio is applicable toMultiSpeedFanonly when the fan speed level selected is the minimum (Speed 1).
Fan Coil Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the fan coil unit fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the fan coil unit  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
Fan Coil Speed Ratio []
This output variable is the ratio of time in a system timestep that the fan coil unit is at rated speed between two consecutive speed levels ( [load - Capacity at Fan Speed i-1] / [Capacity at Fan Speed i - Capacity at Fan Speed i-1]). The fan speed ratio has minimum value of 0.0, and a maximum value of 1.0 and any value in between as it is averaged over the timestep. The value is 0.0 during Speed Level 1 operation. Hydronic FanCoil units speed ratio depends on the fan speed and current load. The speed ratio represents how long the higher speed runs as a fraction of the system timestep, and the lower speed runs in the rest of the system timestep.
ZoneHVAC:UnitVentilator
Unit ventilators are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components. They contain a built-in outdoor air mixer, a fan, a heating coil, and a cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document, except the built-in outdoor air mixer which is contained within the unit ventilator statement. The unit ventilator input simply requires the names of these other three components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, outdoor air control information (control type and schedules) and an outdoor airflow rate. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes and the outdoor air by specifying unit inlet, outlet, outdoor air, mixed air and exhaust (relief) air node names. Note that if the Unit Ventilator is not connected to central dedicated outdoor air (DOA), then the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust air node and the unit air outlet node should be the same as a zone air inlet node. The three node name input fields:Outdoor Air Node Name,Exhaust Air Node Name, andMixed Air Node Nameare required fields only when the built-in outdoor air mixer is used to provide outdoor air. If the Unit Ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) viaAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer, then the above three node name input fields are not required and must be left blank. In the later case the Unit Ventilator node connection to the zone air exhaust node and the zone air inlet node are described inAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject. In general, the unit ventilator input is very similar to the fan coil unit input, and the unit is connected to a hot water loop (demand side) through its hot water coil and to a chilled water loop (demand side) through its cooling coil.
The main difference between the fan coil and unit ventilator input is that the unit ventilator has a built-in outdoor air mixer with its own specialized controls. The outdoor air control type can be selected from one of the following options: “variable percent”, “fixed temperature” or “fixed amount”. In fixed temperature control, the amount of outdoor air is varied between the minimum outdoor air fraction (specified by a schedule) and 100% outdoor air to obtain a mixed air temperature as close as possible to the temperature schedule defined in the input. Variable percent control will also vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum and maximum fractions (both specified in input by the user) to meet the load without the use of a coil if possible. In fixed amount control, the outdoor air flow rate is fixed to the specified value by the user. In this control strategy, the maximum outdoor air flow rate and schedule are automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule. These control types are based on the 2004 ASHRAE Systems and Equipment Handbook (pp. 31.1-31.3) description of unit ventilator systems. The three outdoor air control strategies are also valid and available when the Unit Ventilator is connected to central DOA.
The unit is controlled to meet the zone (remaining) heating or cooling demand. If there is a heating demand, the cooling coil is off and the hot water flow through the heating coil is throttled to meet the demand. If there is a cooling demand from the zone, the hot water coil is off and the chilled water flow through the cooling coil is throttled to meet the load. Finally both heating and cooling require a convergence tolerance, which is the tolerance denoting how closely the fan coil unit will meet the heating or cooling load. The tolerance is always relative to the zone load.
Overall, control of the unit must consider the outdoor air. Here is a more detailed description of the overall unit control:
Off:Unit is schedule off or there is no load on it. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions (except for the outdoor air inlet). Outdoor air requirements will not override this condition.
Heating/No Coil/VariablePercent:The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the maximum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
Heating/No Coil/FixedTemperature:The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate.
Heating/No Coil/FixedAmount:The unit is on, there is a heating load, no heating coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
Heating /With Coil/VariablePercent:The unit is on, there is a heating load, and variable percent control is specified. The outdoor air fraction is set to the minimum outdoor air fraction (schedule based), and the heating coil is activated. The heating coil attempts to meet the remaining load on the zone being served by the unit ventilator.
Heating /With Coil/FixedAmount:The unit is on, there is a heating load, a heating coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The heating coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone heating load.
Cooling/No Coil/VariablePercent:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is varied up to the maximum flow rate to try to meet whatever cooling load is present. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outdoor air controls.
Cooling/No Coil/FixedTemperature:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the variable percent outdoor air control.
Cooling/No Coil/FixedAmount:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, no cooling coil is present or it has been scheduled off, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. Since a coil is not present to further condition the supply air, the zone simply receives whatever temperature air results from the outside air controls.
Cooling/With Coil/VariablePercent:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a coil is present and is scheduled on, and variable percent outdoor air control type has been specified. In this case, the variable percent outdoor air controls what happens with the outdoor air. If the outside temperature is greater than the return temperature, then the outdoor air is set to the minimum as defined by the user input. If the outdoor air temperature is less than the return temperature from the zone, then the outdoor air is varied up to the maximum flow rate to try to meet whatever cooling load is present. The coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.
Cooling/With Coil/FixedTemperature:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed temperature has been specified. The unit ventilator tries to use outdoor air as best as possible to meet the temperature goal. If it cannot meet this goal because the temperature goal is not between the zone return temperature and the outdoor air temperature, then the unit ventilator will either use the maximum or minimum outdoor air flow rate in the same fashion as the fixed temperature outdoor air control for the “no coil” conditions. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone load.
Cooling/With Coil/FixedAmount:The unit is on, there is a cooling load, a cooling coil is present and is scheduled on, and fixed amount control has been specified. The unit ventilator fixes the outdoor air flow rate as defined by the user and sets the maximum and minimum outdoor air flow rate to be equal in order to avoid the variation of outdoor air flow rate between the maximum and minimum values. The cooling coil then attempts to meet any remaining zone cooling load.
Note: the unit ventilator controls are strictly temperature based and do not factor humidity into the equation (not an enthalpy economy cycle but rather a simple return air economy cycle). In addition, temperature predictions are not strict energy balances here in the control routine though in the mixing routine an energy balance is preserved.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular unit ventilator from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other unit ventilators use this same name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the unit ventilator is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of air through the unit ventilator system in m/sec. This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.
Field: Outdoor Air Control Type
This field allows the user to control how outdoor air is used in the unit ventilator system. The unit ventilator system described by this syntax has its own outdoor air handler. The three options for outdoor air control are “VariablePercent”, “FixedTemperature” and “FixedAmount”. Those keys are the only allowed choices for this parameter. In general, the variable percent control will attempt to vary the amount of outdoor air between some minimum and maximum schedules of fractions (see next two fields) to best meet the current heating or cooling load. The fixed temperature control will vary the amount of outdoor air between the minimum schedule (fraction of maximum, see next field) and 100% available outdoor air to come as close as possible to a desired mixed air temperature (see 2 fields down) that can be scheduled. The fixed amount control will fix the outdoor air flow rate as minimum outdoor air flow rate and schedule specified by the user and automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate. More information on the controls and operation of the unit ventilator are given in the introductory section above. For cycling fan operating mode, the outdoor air mass rate is capped by the actual supply air flow rate if the former is greater than the latter; otherwise, uses the amount calculated by the outdoor air control.
Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the minimum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air (in m/sec) that will be brought in to the unit ventilator. The actual minimum outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the minimum outdoor air schedule. If “FixedAmount” type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the outdoor air flow rate will be fixed as this field and the unit ventilator will automatically set the maximum and minimum outside flow rate to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air flow rate.
Field: Minimum Outdoor Air Schedule Name
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that should contain values for the minimum outdoor air used by the unit ventilator system for IAQ or other reasons. Note that if the unit ventilator is scheduled off or if there is no load sensed in the zone that the system will not operate even to achieve the minimum air fraction. However, if the system is operating, it will always bring in this fraction of the minimum air flow rate (see minimum air flow rate field above). If “FixedAmount” type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, the actual outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the minimum outdoor air flow rate in the field above. The unit ventilator will automatically set the maximum and minimum outdoor air schedule to be equal by ignoring the maximum outdoor air schedule.
Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of outdoor air that can be brought into the unit ventilator system in m/sec. This parameter should be some real number greater than zero. Note that the value for this parameter may be less than the maximum air flow rate of the unit ventilator and this may affect the maximum fraction of outdoor air within the control strategy defined above. This parameter is an absolute maximum and will supercede any scheduled fraction of the unit ventilator maximum airflow rate. If “FixedAmount” type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air flow rate specified in the field above.
Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Fraction or Temperature Schedule Name
This field can have one of two meanings depending the type of control selected in the outdoor air control type parameter above. If “VariablePercent” or “FixedAmount” was selected, then this field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) corresponding to a maximum air fraction schedule. Furthermore, if “FixedAmount” type is selected as the outdoor air control strategy, this field will be ignored and be automatically set to be equal to the minimum outdoor air fraction specified in the field below. Note that this is a fraction of the maximum airflow rate field (see parameter above) for the unit ventilator. If “FixedTemperature” control was selected, then this field is still a schedule name (ref: Schedule), but it corresponds to a schedule of mixed air temperatures that the outdoor air control will try to attain.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the unit ventilator. In a unit ventilator, the air inlet node name must be zone exhaust node name if there is no DOA Mixer, or if the unit ventilator is connected to DOA, then the air inlet node name must be the DOA mixer outlet node name for InletSide mixer connection. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name. In addition, the air inlet node name can be the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref.AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum)to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) to the unit ventilator. In a unit ventilator, the air outlet node name must be zone inlet node name if there is no DOA Mixer, or if the unit ventilator is connected to DOA, then the air outlet node name must be the DOA mixer secondary air inlet node name for SupplySide mixer connection. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Outdoor Air Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with fresh air brought into the unit ventilator from the outdoor environment. You should also have defined anOutdoorAir:Nodeobject with the same name and assign it an optional height (above ground). This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) viaAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Exhaust Air Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with air exhausted out of the unit ventilator to the outdoor environment. While from a simulation standpoint this name is arbitrary and not a “necessity”, assigning a name to this node allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node to verify the correct operation of the unit ventilator. This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) viaAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Mixed Air Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with the “mixed” air of the unit ventilator. These conditions are post-“mixing box” since they are the conditions of the fraction of return air combined with the outdoor air. Since this is a simple system, this can also be viewed as the conditions of the air being sent to the coils. While from a simulation standpoint this name is arbitrary and not a “necessity”, assigning a name to this node allows the user to receive output on conditions at this node to verify the correct operation of the unit ventilator. This input field must be left blank if the Unit ventilator is connected to a central dedicated outdoor air (DOA) viaAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by this unit ventilator. The supply air fan is part of the unit ventilator compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
Fan:SystemModelFan:OnOffFan:ConstantVolumeFan:VariableVolume
Fan:SystemModel
Fan:OnOff
Fan:ConstantVolume
Fan:VariableVolume
Note thatFan:SystemModelwas added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.Fan:OnOff,Fan:ConstantVolume,andFan:VariableVolumemay be deprecated in a future version.
Field: Supply Air Fan Name
This field is the name of a fan (ref:Fan:SystemModel,Fan:OnOff,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:VariableVolume)that is part of the unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the unit ventilator system.
Field: Coil Option
This field allows the user to specify the coil operating options as one of the following options:None,Heating,CoolingorHeatingAndCooling. IfNoneis selected, the unit ventilator does not have any coils, and any other input will be ignored. If eitherHeatingorCoolingis selected, only a heating or cooling coil, respectively, is present. Thus, only four more inputs will be expected. IfHeatingAndCoolingis selected, both heating and cooling coil input must be entered, and the unit ventilator will have both a heating and a cooling coil.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines the operating modes of the unit ventilator's On:Off fan. A schedule value of 0 indicates cycling fan operation (fan cycles with cooling/heating coil). A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates constant fan operation (fan runs continually regardless of the coils operation). If this input field is left blank, then the operating mode of the On:Off fan type defaults to cycling operation.
Field: Heating Coil Object Type
This field is the type of coil that is used for heating in the unit ventilator system. It is used in conjunction with the heating coil name (see next field) to specify the heating coil present within the system. Allowable heating coil types are:
Coil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Heating Coil Name
This field is the name of the heating coil that is part of the unit ventilator system. It is assumed that there is always some sort of heating coil associated with a unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular heating coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file.
Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance
The control tolerance for the unit heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heating coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point. This field is ignored for gas and electric heating coils.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:

Field: Cooling Coil Object Type
This field is the type of coil that is used for cooling in the unit ventilator system. It is used in conjunction with the cooling coil name (see next field) to specify the cooling coil present within the system.
Only the following coil types can be used:
Coil:Cooling:WaterCoil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometryCoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted
Coil:Cooling:Water
Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry
CoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted
Field: Cooling Coil Name
This field is the name of the cooling coil that is part of the unit ventilator system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular cooling coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file. Note that a cooling coil is not a required part of a unit ventilator system. If no cooling coil is present, the previous field may be followed by a semi-colon and the remaining parameters in this statement may be ignored.
Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance
The convergence tolerance for the unit cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the cooling coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:

Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this unit ventilator object's fan. If the unit ventilator is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this unit ventilator object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Maximum Air Flow Rate in this Unit Ventilator zone HVAC object. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
An example input for a unit ventilator, including its constituent components, is shown below.

Zone Unit Ventilator Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the unit ventilator fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the unit ventilator  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
Zone Unit Ventilator Fan Part Load Ratio []
This is the fan's part load ratio for the report timestep during which the fan had operated. This variable is available for OnOff supply air fan type only.
ZoneHVAC:UnitHeater
Unit heaters are zone equipment units which are assembled from other components and are a simplification of unit ventilators. They contain only a fan and a heating coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The unit heater input simply requires the names of these components, which have to be described elsewhere in the input. The input also requires the name of an availability schedule, maximum airflow rate, and maximum and minimum hot water volumetric flow rates. The unit is connected to the zone inlet and exhaust nodes by specifying unit inlet and outlet node names. Note that the unit air inlet node should be the same as a zone exhaust node and the unit outlet node should be the same as a zone inlet node.
While the control of the heating coil is similar to the fan coil units and the unit ventilator, the overall control of the unit heater is much different. There are four different modes in which a unit heat can operate based on the user input:
Off:Unit is schedule off. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.
NoLoad OR Cooling/“No”is specified in input field “Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating”:Unit is available, but there is no heating load. With “No” specified for “Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating” and the supply fan operating mode set to 0, the fan will be off since there is no heating load. All flow rates are set to zero and the temperatures are set to zone conditions.
NoLoad OR Cooling/“Yes”is specified in input field “Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating”:Unit is available, the supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0 (for OnOff Fan) and the fan is running (if it is scheduled to be available also). No heating is provided, only air circulation via the fan running. However, any heat added by the fan is introduced into the space with the circulation of the air.
Heating:The unit is on/available and there is a heating load. The heating coil is modulated (constant fan speed) to meet the heating load. When the fan type is not an OnOff fan then the  control of the heating coil and its flow rate is identical to the fan coil unit. In the case of OnOff fan, the fan cycles with heating coil if the current timestep supply fan operating mode is schedule value is 0, or else if the current timestep supply fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0, then the supply fan runs continuously for the entire timestep.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular unit heater from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other unit heaters use this same name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the unit heater is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the component can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the component must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the unit heater. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In a unit heater, the air inlet node to the system will typically be the same node as a zone outlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) to the unit heater. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In a unit heater, the air outlet node from the system will typically be the same node as a zone inlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by this unit heater. The supply air fan is part of the unit heater compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
Fan:SystemModelFan:OnOffFan:ConstantVolumeFan:VariableVolume
Fan:SystemModel
Fan:OnOff
Fan:ConstantVolume
Fan:VariableVolume
Note thatFan:SystemModelwas added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.Fan:OnOff,Fan:ConstantVolume,andFan:VariableVolumemay be deprecated in a future version.
Field: Supply Air Fan Name
This field is the name of a fan (ref: FanSystemModel,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:VariableVolume)that is part of the unit heater system. This name links the unit heater to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the unit heater system.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the maximum volumetric flow rate of air through the unit heater system in m/s. This parameter should be some real number greater than zero.
Field: Heating Coil Object Type
This field is the type of coil that is used for heating in the unit heater system. It is used in conjunction with the heating coil name (see next field) to specify the heating coil present within the system. Allowable heating coil types are:
Coil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Heating Coil Name
This field is the name of the heating coil that is part of the unit heater system. It is assumed that there is always some sort of heating coil associated with a unit heater system. This name links the unit ventilator to particular heating coil data entered elsewhere in the input data file.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines the operating modes of the unit heater's On:Off fan. A schedule value of 0 indicates cycling fan operation (fan cycles with cooling/heating coil). A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates constant fan operation (fan runs continually regardless of the coils operation). If this input field is left blank, then the operating mode of the On:Off fan type defaults to cycling operation.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operation During No Heating
This choice field allows the user to define how the unit heater will operate under “no heating load” or cooling conditions. The user may select from two options (“Yes”, “No”). If the “No” control is selected, then the fan will not run unless there is a heating load. If the fan does not run, this effectively shuts the unit heater system off. If the “Yes” control is selected, the unit heater is available, and the fan is continuous, then the fan will always run. This will produce air movement in the zone but also add some amount of heat to the energy balance since the fan generates some heat. But if the “Yes” control is selected and the “Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule” values is 0 (for OnOff fan), then the fan will NOT run.  This allows the user to schedule the operation of the fan when there is no load.
Field: Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter a maximum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate through the heating coil in m/s. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This number should be some number greater than zero and greater than the minimum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate (see next field). Note that this parameter has no meaning for either an electric or a gas heating coil.
Field: Minimum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter a minimum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate through the heating coil in m/s. The steam volume flow rate is calculated at 100C and 101325 Pa. This number should be some number greater than zero and less than the maximum hot water or steam volumetric flow rate (see previous field). Note that this parameter has no meaning for either an electric or a gas heating coil.
Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance
The convergence tolerance for the unit heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heating coil will control the air side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in supply conditions (that could in turn result in excessive iterations). Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as a starting point. This field is ignored for gas and electric heating coils.
The unit is controlled by matching the unit output to the zone demand. For units with water coils, the model must be numerically inverted to obtain a specified output. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the numerical inversion procedure. Basically this is the fraction:

Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this unit heater object's fan. If the unit heater is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this unit heater object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fieldsMaximum Supply Air Flow Ratein this Unit Heater zone HVAC object. The scaled maximum supply air flow rates is used to size Maximum Hot Water or Steam Flow Rate if specified as autosize. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size heating capacity of the unit.
An example input for a unit heater, including its constituent components, is shown below.

Zone Unit Heater Fan Part Load Ratio []
This is the fan's part load ratio for the report timestep during which the fan had operated. This variable is available for OnOff supply air fan type only.
ZoneHVAC:EvaporativeCoolerUnit
The zone evaporative cooler unit is a compound object made up of a fan and one or two evaporative cooler components.  This unit serves a single thermal zone as a forced-convection, cooling-only unit with supply fan.  It always draws 100% of its supply air from the outside, passes the air through a supply fan and evaporative cooler(s) and then into the zone.  The fan can be positioned upstream of the cooler(s) for a blow through placement.  Or it can be positioned downstream of the cooler(s) for a draw through placement.  If there is more than one evaporative cooler, then should be in series with the first cooler immediately upstream of the second cooler. There is an option to include a relief zone exhaust node to balance the air in the zone.
The unit can have either constant or variable speed fans.  When a constant speed fan is specified and the Cooler Unit Control Method is eitherZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCyclingorZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling, this zone unit runs just like other constant speed forced-air zone units in that its controls allow the unit to cycle based on a part-load formulation with averaged air flow rates. When a variable speed fan is specified and the Cooler Unit Control Method isZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan, then the unit can modulate fan speed to meet cooling loads just like other zone HVAC units with variable speed fan.
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a zone evaporative cooler unit.  References to this unit by other objects will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This alpha field defines the name of a schedule that denotes whether the unit operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0.0 denotes that the cooler unit must be off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0.0 denotes that the cooler is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, then the program assumes that the unit is always available as if the schedule was always set to 1.0.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional alpha input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name.  The availability managers in the list apply to this evaporative cooler unit's operation. If this field is used and the cooler unit is scheduled to be available, based on the previous input field, then the unit will operate based on the result of the availability managers in the list.
Field: Outdoor Air Inlet Node Name
This alpha input field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the evaporative cooler unit draws its supply air.  This node is usually declared to be an outdoor air node usingOutdoorAir:NodeorOutdoorAir:NodeList.
Field: Cooler Outlet Node Name
This alpha input field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the evaporative cooler sends its outlet air.  This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Field: Zone Relief Air Node Name
This optional alpha input field defines the name of an HVAC system node which can extract air from the zone to balance the air supplied to the zone by the cooler outlet node.  This node name would match the name of a zone exhaust air node.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This alpha input field defines the type of fan used by the zone evaporative cooler unit. There are five valid choices:Fan:SystemModel,Fan:ComponentModel,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,orFan:VariableVolume.(Note thatFan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,andFan:VariableVolumemay be deprecated in a future version and as of version 8.7 these are being replaced byFan:SystemModel.)However the type of fan must be consistent with the control method defined below and a variable speed fan is needed with ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.
Field: Supply Air Fan Name
This alpha input field defines the user-defined name of the fan used by this cooler unit. The fan itself is defined elsewhere.  Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the Design Supply Air Flow Rate defined in the following field.  For a blow-through fan placement, the fan's inlet node should be the same as the Outlet Air Inlet Node Name. For a draw-through fan placement, the fan's outlet node should be the same as the Cooler Outlet Node Name.
Field: Design Supply Air Flow Rate [m/s]
This numeric input field defines the evaporative cooler unit's design supply air flow rate, in cubic meters per second.  This value must be less than or equal to the maximum air flow rate of the fan.
Field: Fan Placement
This alpha input field defines how the supply fan is arranged.  There are two choices, BlowThrough or DrawThrough.  The BlowThrough choice indicates that the fan is located upstream of the evaporative cooler(s). The DrawThrough choice indicates that the fan is located downstream of the evaporative cooler(s). These are the only configurations that are available and the HVAC system nodes used as inlets and outlet in the components must be arranged consistent with the flow path.
Field: Cooler Unit Control Method
This alpha field is used to determine how the unit is to be controlled.  There are three possible choices:
ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the thermostat setpoint and the zone air temperature.  This thermostatic control method uses a throttling temperature range, determined in the following input field, to model hysteresis-type control to avoid excessive short-cycling.  If the zone air temperature is warmer than the cooling setpoint temperature plus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate.  If the zone air temperature is cooler than the cooling setpoint temperature minus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is off for the entire timestep.  When the zone air temperatures are within the throttling range, then the unit will stay off if it was not running during the previous timestep and will stay on if it was already running. If the unit is On, then the unit is cycled such that it meets the current cooling load and avoids over-cooling the zone.ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.  If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate. If there is no cooling load, then the unit is cycled at the design air mass flow rate such that it meets the current cooling load.  The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.  This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.  If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at a fan speed that is controlled to meet the sensible cooling load (if possible). The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.  This control method requires a variable speed fan and cannot be used withFan:ConstantVolumeorFan:OnOff.
ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the thermostat setpoint and the zone air temperature.  This thermostatic control method uses a throttling temperature range, determined in the following input field, to model hysteresis-type control to avoid excessive short-cycling.  If the zone air temperature is warmer than the cooling setpoint temperature plus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate.  If the zone air temperature is cooler than the cooling setpoint temperature minus one-half of the throttling range, then the unit is off for the entire timestep.  When the zone air temperatures are within the throttling range, then the unit will stay off if it was not running during the previous timestep and will stay on if it was already running. If the unit is On, then the unit is cycled such that it meets the current cooling load and avoids over-cooling the zone.
ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling. This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.  If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at the design air mass flow rate. If there is no cooling load, then the unit is cycled at the design air mass flow rate such that it meets the current cooling load.  The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.
ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.  This control method determines whether or not to operate the cooler based on the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint.  If there is a cooling load (and the unit is available), then the unit is operated for the entire timestep at a fan speed that is controlled to meet the sensible cooling load (if possible). The magnitude of the cooling load that will trigger the unit to operate can be controlled using the field below called Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate.  This control method requires a variable speed fan and cannot be used withFan:ConstantVolumeorFan:OnOff.
Field: Throttling Range Temperature Difference [DeltaC]
This numeric input field defines the throttling range to use for zone-temperature based control, in degrees Celsius. This value is used when the unit's control method is ZoneTemperatureDeadbandOnOffCycling.  This temperature range is used for hysteresis thermostatic control.  It is modeled as symmetric about the cooling setpoint. The default is 1.0°C.
Field: Cooling Load Control Threshold Heat Transfer Rate [W]
This numeric input field defines the magnitude, in Watts, of a significant zone cooling load to use with zone-load-to-setpoint based control.  This value is used when the unit's control method is ZoneCoolingLoadOnOffCycling or ZoneCoolingLoadVariableSpeedFan.  This is a sensible cooling load that is used as a threshold to determine when the cooling load is significant.  When the predicted zone load to cooling setpoint is less than this threshold, the cooler unit's control will consider the load to be too small to trigger operation. The default is 100W.
Field: First Evaporative Cooler Object Type
This alpha input field defines the type of evaporative cooler used in the unit. The zone evaporative cooler unit can have one or two separate cooler components and this field is for the first cooler. There are five types of evaporative cooler component models to choose from:EvaporativeCooler:Direct:CelDekPad,EvaporativeCooler:Direct:ResearchSpecial,EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:CelDekPad,EvaporativeCooler:Indirect:WetCoil,orEvaporativeCooler:Indirect:ResearchSpecial.
Field: First Evaporative Cooler Object Name
This alpha input field defines the user-defined name of the first evaporative cooler component used by this zone unit.  The cooler component itself is defined elsewhere. For a blow through fan placement, the inlet node for the evaporative cooler should be the same as the fan's outlet node.

Zone Evaporative Cooler Unit Total Cooling Energy [J]
This output is the total (enthalpy) heat extraction of the zone evaporative cooler unit from the zone it is serving, in Joules.  This value is calculated using the enthalpy difference of the unit outlet air node and the zone air node and the air mass flow rate entering the zone.
Zone Evaporative Cooler Unit Sensible Cooling Rate [W]
This output is the moist air sensible-only heat extraction rate of the zone evaporative cooler unit from the zone it is serving, in Watts. This value is calculated using the enthalpy difference of the unit outlet air node and the zone air node based on a single, minimum humidity ratio along with the air mass flow rate entering the zone.

This output is the speed ratio of the fan for the zone evaporative cooler unit.  The speed ratio is defined as the current supply air mass flow rate divided by the design air mass flow rate.
Zone Evaporative Cooler Unit Fan Availability Status []
This output is the availability status of the zone evaporative cooler unit's fan.  This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object.  TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the zone evaporative cooler object.  When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific manager.  For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager)), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section on system availability managers.  The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3.  These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn(2), and CycleOneZoneFansOnly (3).  It is recommend to report this output at the “Detailed” frequency because the integer status flags do not average out to meaningful values.
ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit
The zone outdoor air unit(ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit)in EnergyPlus is intended to model dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) and other similar systems which aim to provide either additional outside air or some limited amount of sensible and/or latent conditioning.  The zone outdoor air unit is a piece of zone equipment that can consist of a supply fan, an exhaust fan (optional), heating and cooling coils, and heat recovery.  The outdoor air unit input simply requires information about flow rates, schedules, node names, and a list of component that are part of the unit.  These components require additional input as per the requirements for these components.  In addition, the input includes information about controls for the unit.  It should be noted that the components that make up the zone outdoor air unit do not require additional controls or setpoints.  The unit input defines how the unit outlet temperature is controlled as described below.
Zone Outdoor Air Unit Schematic[fig:zone-outdoor-air-unit-schematic]
When anAirloopHVACserves the same zone, it is strongly recommended that the outdoor and exhaust air flow rates are balanced. In addition, the exhaust airflow rate and air schedule should be the same as outdoor air flow rate and outdoor air schedule, respectively. Otherwise, possible unbalanced flows will cause improper return airflow unlessZoneAirMassFlowConservationis active.
The full input for zone outdoor air units is described below using a variety of fields.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is simply the identifying name that distinguishes one particular outdoor air unit from another in the input data file. Like all other names in EnergyPlus, it is assumed that this is a unique character string and that no other zone outdoor air units use this same name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This field is a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that determines whether the zone outdoor air unit is available to operate. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the outdoor air unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the outdoor air unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. For any schedule value greater than zero, the outdoor air unit is considered available and will operate at the supply and exhaust flow rates defined by input field described below.
Field: Zone Name
This field is the name of the zone (Ref:Zone)in which the outdoor air unit is located and intended to affect.Zoneoutdoor air units impact only a single zone.
Field: Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the volumetric flow rate of outdoor air (in m/sec) that will be brought in through the outdoor air unit. The actual outdoor air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the outdoor air schedule. This field is autosizable.  When autosized, the unit's outdoor air flow rate will match the minimum outdoor air requirements specified through theSizing:Zoneobject.
Field: Outdoor Air Schedule Name
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that contains values for modifying the outdoor air flow rate.  The supply air flow rate is the product of the outdoor air flow rate and the outdoor air schedule value for the time of interest.  Note that if the outdoor air unit is scheduled off that the system will not operate regardless of the outdoor air schedule value. However, if the system is operating, it will always bring in this fraction of the outdoor air flow rate.
Field: Supply Fan Name
This field is the name of a fan (ref:Fan:SystemModel,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:VariableVolume)that is part of the zone outdoor air unit. This name links the outdoor air unit to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. A fan name is required since it is the prime mover of air in the outdoor air control unit.
Field: Fan Placement
This field has two choices:BlowThroughorDrawThrough. The first choice stands for “blow through fan”. It means that the unit consists of outdoor air node followed by a supply fan followed by the equipment that are part of the system. The second choice stands for “draw through fan”. It means that the supply fan placed at the end of supply air stream and supply fan outlet node is identified with the air outlet node. The fan “draws air through” the equipment system.
BlowThroughDrawThrough
BlowThrough
DrawThrough
If the user does not select a fan placement type,DrawThroughis assumed as default by EnergyPlus.
Field: Exhaust Fan Name
This field is the name of a fan (ref:Fan:SystemModel,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:VariableVolume)that is part of the outdoor air unit. This name links the outdoor air unit to particular fan data entered elsewhere in the input data file. This field is optional.
Field: Exhaust Air Flow Rate
This field allows the user to enter the volumetric flow rate of air (in m/sec) that will be exhausted to the outdoors. The actual exhaust air flow rate will be this number multiplied by the schedule value from the exhaust air schedule. If the exhaust fan name is left blank, this field will be ignored and automatically set to be equal to zero.
Field: Exhaust Air Schedule Name
This field contains a schedule name (ref: Schedule) that should contain values for modifying the exhaust air flow rate.  The actual exhaust air flow rate equals the exhaust air flow rate input (previous field) multiplied by the exhaust air schedule value. If the exhaust fan name is left blank, this field will be ignored and automatically set to be equal to zero.
Field: Unit Control Type
The unit control type field determines with conditions in the zone being served what the response of the zone outdoor air system will be. It is important to note that this only controls the temperature of the air being delivered to the space not whether or not the system will operate.  There are two options for this field: Neutral or Temperature. Neutral control tries to have no energy impact on the zone by delivering air at the temperature of the zone. This allows air to be delivered to the zone without affecting the zone air heat balance and thus provides outside air without impacting any other system providing conditioning to this zone. The temperature control option will supply air to the zone based on the high and low air control temperature schedules (see next two fields). For temperature control, when the outside air temperature is less than the low air control temperature, the zone outdoor air unit will provide whatever heating is available from its components to achieve the low air temperature value.  When the outside air temperature is above the high air control temperature, the zone outdoor air unit will provide whatever cooling is available from its components to achieve the high air temperature value.  When the outdoor air temperature is between the high and low air control temperatures, the unit will simply provide air at whatever the outdoor air conditions are, modified by any fan heat added by the supply fan. In summary, the user must select from the following two options:
NeutralControlTemperatureControl
NeutralControl
TemperatureControl
If the user does not select a unit control type,NeutralControlis assumed as the default by EnergyPlus.
Field: High Air Control Temperature Schedule Name
This field specifies the dry-bulb air temperature in degrees Celsius for the supply air temperature to the zone. When the outdoor air temperature or post-supply fan outlet temperature in the case of blow through is above the high air control temperature, a cooling coil, if available and specified by the user, is tuned on to conditioning the outdoor air to the high control temperature. This field only applies to zone outdoor air units that use Temperature Control (see previous field).
Field: Low Air Control Temperature Schedule Name
This field specifies the dry-bulb air temperature in degrees Celsius for the supply air temperature to the zone. When the outdoor air temperature or post-supply fan outlet temperature is below the low air control temperature, a heating coil, if available and specified by the user, is tuned on to conditioning the outdoor air to the low control temperature. This field only applies to zone outdoor air units that use Temperature Control (see two previous fields).
Field: Outdoor Air Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node associated with fresh air brought into the outdoor air unit from the outdoor environment. It should also be defined in anOutdoorAir:Nodeobject with the same name and assigned an optional height (above ground).
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) from the zone outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In an outdoor air unit, the air outlet node from the system will typically be the same node as a zone inlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the inlet (air side) to the exhaust side of the outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. In an outdoor air unit, the air inlet node of the system will typically be the same node as a zone outlet node. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Supply Fan Outlet Node Name
This field is a node name used to identify the node that serves as the outlet (air side) of the supply fan for the zone outdoor air unit. In EnergyPlus, nodes represent points between components or at various points in the loops. While a node name may be referenced more than once in an input data file, each node must have a unique name.
Field: Outdoor Air Unit List Name
This field is the name of anZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentListobject. AnZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit:EquipmentListis simply a list of components giving both component name and type. This equipment list specifies all the components that will be simulated in this unit. The order of the components in the list is significant: components are simulated sequentially in the order given in the Equipment List.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this outdoor air unit  object's fan. If the outdoor air unit is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this outdoor air unit  object should be on or off.
An example of this object defined in an input data file is shown below:

ZoneHVAC:WindowAirConditioner
TheWindowAir Conditioner is a unit of zone equipment made up of other components. Each window air conditioner consists of an outdoor air mixer, a fan, and a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil. These components are described elsewhere in this document. The input for a window air conditioner requires the names of these three pieces of equipment, which are then specified individually elsewhere in the input. The input for a window air conditioner also requires the name of an availability schedule, the maximum unit airflow rate, and the maximum outdoor airflow rate for the unit. The unit is connected to a zone by specifying an air inlet node, which must be the same as a zone exhaust node; and an air outlet node, which must be the same as a zone inlet node (ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
A supply air fan operating mode schedule must also be specified. The supply air fan operating mode schedule value determines if the supply air fan can run continuously with the DX coil cycling on/off to match the zone cooling demand or the fan and DX coil can cycle on/off together to meet the cooling demand. The placement of the supply air fan, in relation to the DX coil, must also be specified (blow through or draw through). The cooling convergence tolerance is required, which is the tolerance denoting how closely the window air conditioner will meet the cooling load. The tolerance is always relative to the zone load (i.e., the unit will operate to meet the zone load to within the tolerance value times the zone load for each simulation timestep). Finally, the DX cooling coil type must be specified.
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique user assigned name for an instance of a window air conditioner unit. Any reference to this window air conditioner by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the window air conditioner unit can run during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can be on during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit must be off for the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Flow Rate
The maximum volumetric airflow rate through the window air conditioner in cubic meters per second. Since the unit operates by cycling on/off, this is also the design, rated airflow rate of the unit.
Field: Maximum Outdoor Air Flow Rate
If the window air conditioner uses outdoor air, this field specifies the outdoor air volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per second. This flow rate should be less than or equal to the maximum airflow rate. A value of zero specifies no outdoor air. Note that the outdoor airflow rate is fixed: it cannot change during the simulation
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
The name of the HVAC system node (see Node) from which the window air conditioner draws its indoor air. This should be one of the zone exhaust nodes for the zone which the window air conditioner is cooling.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
The name of the HVAC system node (see Node) to which the window air conditioner sends its outlet air. This should be one of the inlet air nodes for the zone which is being cooled.
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this window air conditioner unit. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the window air conditioner compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
OutdoorAir:Mixer
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name
The name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the window air conditioner unit. Note that the return air node of the outdoor air mixer should be the same node as the air inlet node of the window air conditioner. In addition, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the window air conditioner's fan inlet air node (for blow through) or the air conditioner's DX coil inlet node (for draw through)
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This field specifies the type of supply air fan used by window air conditioner. The supply air fan is part of the window air conditioner compound object. The only valid supply air fan types are:
Fan:SystemModelFan:OnOffFan:ConstantVolume
Fan:SystemModel
Fan:OnOff
Fan:ConstantVolume
Note thatFan:SystemModelwas added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.Fan:OnOffand Fan:ConstantVolumemay be deprecated in a future version.
Field:Supply Air Fan Name
The name of the fan component that composes part of the window air conditioner. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be the same as the maximum airflow rate of the window air conditioner. A fan of typeFan:SystemModelorFan:OnOffmay be used with either cycling or continuous fan, and a fan of typeFan:ConstantVolumeis used only with continuous fan (see Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule field below). The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through) or the DX coil's outlet node (for draw through). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX coil's air inlet node (for blow through) or the window air conditioner's air outlet node (for draw through).
Field: Cooling Coil Object Type
This field specifies the type of cooling coil to be modeled for this window air conditioner. The input requirements for these cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. If the user wants to control the enhanced dehumidification performance of the Heat Exchanger Assisted coil type based on zone air humidity level, then the input file must include a humidistat object (ref.ZoneControl:Humidistat)for the zone being served by this air conditioner and a high humidity set point manager (ref.SetpointManager:SingleZone:Humidity:Maximum)with the high humidity set point placed on the outlet node of the heat exchanger assisted cooling coil. Only allowable coil types are:
Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedCoil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeedCoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
Field: DX Cooling Coil Name
The name of a DX cooling coil component that composes part of the window air conditioner unit. The DX coil air inlet node should be the same as the fan outlet node (for blow through) or the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for draw through). The DX coil air outlet node should be the same as the window air conditioner's air outlet node (for blow through) or the fan's inlet node (for draw through).
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
Field: Fan Placement
This input field has two choices:BlowThroughorDrawThrough. The first choice stands for “blow through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by a DX coil. The fan “blows through” the DX coil. The second choice stands for “draw through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a DX coil followed by a fan. The fan “draws air through” the coil.
Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance
This input field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the air conditioner will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.
The window air conditioner is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) cooling output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX coil is frequently non-linear, the air conditioner model must call the DX coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:

The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this window air conditioner or object's fan. If the window air conditioner is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this window air conditioner object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Maximum Air Flow Rate in thisWindowAir Conditioner zone HVAC object. The scaled Maximum Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling capacity of the unit.
Following is an example input for the cycling window air conditioner, along with its constituent components.

Zone Window Air Conditioner Compressor Part Load Ratio []
This is the part load ratio of the report timestep during which the DX unit compressor had operated.
ZoneWindowAir Conditioner Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the window air conditioner fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the window air conditioner object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner
The packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) is a compound object made up of other components. Each PTAC consists of an outdoor air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, heating coil (gas, electric, hot water, or steam) and a supply air fan. While the figure below shows the PTAC with draw through fan placement, blow through fan placement can also be modeled by positioning the supply air fan between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil. The packaged terminal air conditioner coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of zone equipment (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentListandZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Schematic of a packaged terminal air conditioner with draw through fan placement[fig:schematic-of-a-packaged-terminal-air-001]
Links to the PTAC's supply air fan, DX cooling coil, heating coil, and outdoor air mixer specifications are provided in the air conditioner's input syntax. Additional inputs include supply and outdoor air flow rates during cooling operation, heating operation, and when neither cooling or heating is required. A description of each input field for the packaged terminal air conditioner compound object is provided below.
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a packaged terminal air conditioner. Any reference to this air conditioner by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the air conditioner operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the air conditioner must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the air conditioner is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the air conditioner (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the air conditioner draws its inlet air. This node name must be either the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections)to draw air from a zone directly or the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref.AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum)to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the air conditioner sends its outlet air. This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this PTAC. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the PTAC unit. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
OutdoorAir:Mixer
This input field should be left blank when the PTAC is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the PTAC. The return air node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the PTAC. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the PTAC's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTAC's DX cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This field should be left blank when the PTAC is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., DX coil and heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the air conditioner's supply air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when the heating coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the air conditioner's supply air volumetric flow rate during heating operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the air conditioner in cubic meters per second when neither cooling nor heating is required (i.e., cooling and heating coils are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed cannot be greater than the air conditioner's supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed. This field is only used when the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the air conditioner's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field ‘Supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed' is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate]) and this field is not used. This input field is set to zero flow when the PTAC is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of fan used by this PTAC. The only valid choices areFan:SystemModel,Fan:OnOff, andFan:ConstantVolume. A fan of typeFan:SystemModelorFan:OnOffis used with cycling fan operating mode, and a fan of typeFan:SystemModelorFan:ConstantVolumeis used with continuous fan operating mode (see Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule field below). The input requirements for these fan objects are described elsewhere in this document. Note thatFan:SystemModelwas added as of version 8.7 and is recommended for use in new models.Fan:OnOffandFan:ConstantVolumemay be deprecated in a future version.
Field: Supply Air Fan Name
The name of a constant volume fan component that composes part of the PTAC. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the maximum supply air flow rate for the PTAC. The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through fan placement) or the heating coil's outlet node (for draw through fan placement). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX cooling coil's air inlet node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTAC's air outlet node (for draw through fan placement).
Field: Heating Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of heating coil to be used by this PTAC. The input requirements for this heating coil object are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water flow modulation through the heating coil does not require additional controller orController:WaterCoilobject. The parent object (PTAC) itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow. Allowable heating coil types are:
Coil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Heating Coil Name
This alpha field defines the name of the heating coil used by this PTAC, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
Field: Cooling Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of DX cooling coil used by this PTAC. The input requirements for these DX cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. Only allowable coil types are:
Coil:Cooling:DXCoil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedCoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssistedCoil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
Coil:Cooling:DX
Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
Field: Cooling Coil Name
This alpha field defines the name of the cooling coil used by this PTAC, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding DX cooling coil object.
Field: Fan Placement
This alpha field has two choices:BlowThroughorDrawThrough. The first choice stands for “blow through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by the DX cooling coil and heating coil. The fan “blows through” the DX cooling coil and the heating coil. The second choice stands for “draw through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by the DX cooling coil and heating coil with the fan located at the outlet of the PTAC. The fan “draws air through” the DX cooling coil and the heating coil. If this field is left blank, the default is draw through.
Note: the packaged terminal air conditioner's supply air fan, cooling coil and heating coil must be connected according to the configuration shown above (Figure2) for the draw through fan configuration. The only other valid configuration is with a blow through fan placement, where the fan is located between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this packaged terminal air conditioner or object's fan. If the packaged terminal air conditioner is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this packaged terminal air conditioner object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate in this Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner  zone HVAC object. The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
Field: Capacity Control Method
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices areNoneorSingleZoneVAV. ForNone, the unit varies the fan and/or coil speed to meet the load. If constant fan operating mode is selected the fan operates at the design cooling or heating air flow rate while the coil modulates to meet the load. If cycling fan operating mode is selected the fan and coil modulate in unison to meet the load. ForSingleZoneVAV, the fan air flow rate is reduced to the no load supply air flow rate when the zone sensible load is low such that the maximum supply air temperature limit is not exceeded. If the unit cannot meet the load at this lower air flow rate, the fan speed increases while maintaining the maximum supply air temperature. If the unit still cannot meet the load the unit will operate at the maximum supply air flow rate and the maximum supply air temperature limit can be exceeded. Supply air temperature limits are identified in the input fields for Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode and Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode. Additionally, specific coil types are required for the SingleZoneVAV capacity control method. The cooling coil type isCoil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedwhile the heating coil types areCoil:Heating:Water,Coil:Heating:FuelandCoil:Heating:Electric.If alternate coil types are used they are modeled using the load based control method.
Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the minimum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in cooling mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0°C. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the maximum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in heating mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0°C. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
As shown in the example below, correct specification of the packaged terminal air conditioner requires the following objects in addition to the compound object itself:

Zone Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the packaged terminal air conditioner fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the packaged terminal air conditioner  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref.

For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump
The packaged terminal heat pump (PTHP) is a compound object made up of other components. Each PTHP consists of an outdoor air mixer, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, DX heating coil, supply air fan, and a supplemental heating coil as shown in the figure below. These individual components are described elsewhere in this document. The packaged terminal heat pump coordinates the operation of these components and is modeled as a type of zone equipment (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentListandZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Schematic of a packaged terminal heat pump (draw through fan placement)[fig:schematic-of-a-packaged-terminal-heat-pump-001]
Links to the PTHP's supply air fan, DX coils, supplemental heating coil, and outdoor air mixer specifications are provided in the heat pump's input syntax. Additional inputs include supply and outdoor air flow rates during cooling operation, heating operation, and when neither cooling or heating is required. A description of each input field for the packaged terminal heat pump compound object is provided below.
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field defines a unique user-assigned name for an instance of a packaged terminal heat pump. Any reference to this heat pump by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node from which the heat pump draws its inlet air. This node name must be either the name of a zone air exhaust node (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections)to draw air from a zone directly or the name of an induced air outlet node (Ref.AirLoopHVAC:ReturnPlenum)to draw air from a return plenum, when the zone return node is connected to a return plenum.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This alpha field defines the name of the HVAC system node to which the heat pump sends its outlet air. This node name must be the name of a zone air inlet node (Ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this PTHP. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the PTHP compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
OutdoorAir:Mixer
This input field should be left blank when the PTHP is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the PTHP. Note that the return air node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the PTHP. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the PTHP's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the PTHP's DX cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This field should be left blank when the PTHP is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate during cooling operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTHP is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate during heating operation. This field is set to zero flow when the PTHP is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed. This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field ‘Supply air volumetric flow rate when no cooling or heating is needed' is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the outdoor air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate]) and this field is not used. This field is set to zero flow when the heat pump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of fan used by this PTHP. The only valid choices areFan:OnOffandFan:ConstantVolume.A fan of typeFan:OnOffmay be used with either cycling or continuous fan operating mode, and a fan of typeFan:ConstantVolumeis used only with continuous fan operating mode (see Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule field below). The input requirements for these fan objects are described elsewhere in this document.
Field: Supply Air Fan Name
The name of a constant volume fan component that composes part of the PTHP. Note that the fan's maximum flow rate should be greater than or equal to the maximum supply air flow rate for the PTHP. The fan's inlet node should be the same as the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node (for blow through fan placement) or the DX heating coil's outlet node (for draw through fan placement). The fan's outlet node should be the same as the DX cooling coil's air inlet node (for blow through fan placement) or the supplemental heater's air inlet node (for draw through fan placement).
Field: Heating Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of DX heating coil to be used by this PTHP. The only valid choice areCoil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeedandCoil:Heating:DX:VariableSpeed. The input requirements for this DX heating coil object are described elsewhere in this document.
Field: Heating Coil Name
This alpha field defines the name of the DX heating coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding DX heating coil object.
Field: Heating Convergence Tolerance
This numeric field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's heating output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heat pump will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.
The heat pump is controlled by matching its sensible (temperature) heating output to the zone sensible load (demand). Because the performance of the DX heating coil is frequently non-linear, the heat pump model must call the DX heating coil model several times (iterate) to determine the proper run time fraction to meet the zone load. The heating convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:

The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
Field: Cooling Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of DX cooling coil used by this PTHP. The input requirements for these DX cooling coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. Only allowable coil types are:
Coil:Cooling:DXCoil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedCoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssistedCoil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
Coil:Cooling:DX
Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed
CoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssisted
Coil:Cooling:DX:VariableSpeed
Field: Cooling Coil Name
This alpha field defines the name of the cooling coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding DX cooling coil object.
Field: Cooling Convergence Tolerance
This numeric field defines the convergence tolerance for the unit's cooling output. This field allows the user some control over how closely the heat pump will control the air-side conditions. The relative size of this parameter relates directly to the closeness of the control. A very small value in this field will result in tight control and will probably result in larger numbers of iterations. A large value in this field will result in looser controls and could result in unsatisfactory fluctuations in zone air temperature. Initial experience with this parameter lends to the recommendation of using 0.001 as the starting point.

The cooling convergence tolerance is the error tolerance used to terminate the iteration procedure when the following equation is satisfied:

The maximum number of iterations is limited, with a warning message generated if the above equation is not satisfied within the maximum number of iterations.
Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of supplemental heating coil to be used by this PTHP. The input requirements for these heating coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller orController:WaterCoilobject. The parent object (PTHP) itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow. Allowable coil types are:
Coil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name
This alpha field defines the name of the supplemental heating coil used by this PTHP, and this name should match the name specified in the corresponding heating coil object.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater
This numeric field defines the maximum supply air temperature in degrees Celsius exiting the heat pump supplemental heater coil. The supplemental heater will be controlled so that its supply air temperature does not exceed this value. This field is autosizable.
Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation
This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius for PTHP supplemental heater operation. The supplemental heater will not operate when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is above this value. The maximum value must be less than or equal to 21°C. If this field is left blank, the default value is 21°C.
Field: Fan Placement
This alpha field has two choices:BlowThoughorDrawThrough. The first choice stands for “blow through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by a fan followed by the DX coils and supplemental heating coil. The fan “blows through” the cooling and heating coils. The second choice stands for “draw through fan”. This means that the unit consists of an outdoor air mixer followed by the DX coil(s) followed by a fan, with the supplemental heater located at the outlet of the fan. The fan “draws air through” the DX coil(s). If this field is left blank, the default is draw through.
Note: the packaged terminal heat pump's supply air fan, cooling coil, heating coil and supplementary heating coil must be connected according to the configuration shown above (Figure3) for the draw through fan configuration. The only other valid configuration is with a blow through fan placement, where the fan is located between the outdoor air mixer and the DX cooling coil.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this packaged terminal heat pump or object's fan. If the packaged terminal heat pump is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this packaged terminal heat pump object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate in this PTHP zone HVAC object. The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
Field: Capacity Control Method
This input denotes how the unit's output is controlled in order to meet zone heating or cooling requirement. The choices areNoneorSingleZoneVAV. ForNone, the unit varies the fan and/or coil speed to meet the load. If constant fan operating mode is selected the fan operates at the design cooling or heating air flow rate while the coil modulates to meet the load. If cycling fan operating mode is selected the fan and coil modulate in unison to meet the load. ForSingleZoneVAV, the fan air flow rate is reduced to the no load supply air flow rate when the zone sensible load is low such that the maximum supply air temperature limit is not exceeded. If the unit cannot meet the load at this lower air flow rate, the fan speed increases while maintaining the maximum supply air temperature. If the unit still cannot meet the load the unit will operate at the maximum supply air flow rate and the maximum supply air temperature limit can be exceeded. Supply air temperature limits are identified in the input fields for Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode and Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode. Additionally, specific coil types are required for the SingleZoneVAV capacity control method. The cooling coil type isCoil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedwhile the heating coil type isCoil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed.
Field: Minimum Supply Air Temperature in Cooling Mode
When Capacity Control Method = SingleZoneVAV, enter the minimum air temperature limit for reduced fan speed in cooling mode. For SingleZoneVAV, this field's minimum supply air temperature is 0.0°C. This field is autosizable and the default is autosize.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature in Heating Mode

Zone Packaged Terminal Heat Pump Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the packaged terminal heat pump  fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the packaged terminal heat pump  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:RefrigerationChillerSet
TheZoneHVAC:RefrigerationChillerSetobject works in conjunction with one or multiple air chillers, compressor racks, refrigeration systems, or refrigeration secondary system objects (Ref.Refrigeration:AirChillerRefrigeration:CompressorRack,Refrigeration:System,orRefrigeration:SecondarySystem)to simulate the performance of a group of air chillers cooling a single zone. The chiller set model passes information about the zone conditions to determine the performance of individual chiller coils within the set, thus providing the sensible and latent heat exchange with the zone environment.
The refrigeration chiller set object inputs include a name, an availability schedule name, the name of the zone cooled by the chiller set, the air inlet node name, the air outlet node name, and an extensible list of air chiller names (Ref.Refrigeration:AirChiller).
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of a refrigeration chiller. Any reference to this refrigeration chiller by another object (may be listed in aRefrigeration:CaseAndWalkInList,Refrigeration:System,Refrigeration:SecondarySystem,orRefrigeration:CompressorRack)will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the refrigeration chiller can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (maximum schedule value of 1.0 is typically used) indicates that the refrigeration chiller will operate during a given time period. A value equal to 0 denotes that the case does not operate (everything is OFF: refrigeration, fans, lights, anti-sweat, etc.). Typically the refrigeration chiller will operate throughout the day (i.e., the schedule will contain 1 for all time periods); however, refrigeration chillers require maintenance and/or cleaning and this can be modeled accordingly using this schedule if desired. If this field is left blank, the default schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Zone Name
A unique user-assigned name for the zone cooled by this refrigeration chiller. This zone must represent a conditioned space, that is, it must appear in aZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
Not used, reserved for future use.  Current version exchanges energy directly with the zone, external of any air system. (Future: The name of the zone exhaust node (see Node) from which the refrigeration chiller draws its indoor air. This should be one of the zone exhaust nodes for the zone cooled by the chiller set.)
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
Not used, reserved for future use.  Current version exchanges energy directly with the zone, external of any air system. (Future: The name of the node where the chiller coil sends its outlet air, which must be one of the inlet air nodes for the zone which is being cooled.)
Field: Air Chiller #1  Name
The name of the first air chiller that will be used to meet the zone cooling load.
Field: Air Chiller #2  Name
The name of the second air chiller that will be used to meet the zone cooling load.
Field: Air Chiller #3  Name
The name of the third air chiller that will be used to meet the zone cooling load.
Field: Air Chiller #n  Name
The name of the nth air chiller that will be used to meet the zone cooling load. This object is extensible, so additional fields of this type can be added to the end of this object.
The following is an example input for a refrigeration chiller set.

ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump
The zone water-to-air heat pump is a compound component consisting of a fan, water-to-air cooling and heating coils, and a supplemental heating coil. Links to the fan, WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil, WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil, and supplementary heating coil specifications are provided in the heat pump's input data syntax. The heat pump switches between cooling and heating depending on the zone's demand. The load side (air) of the zone water-to-air heat pump consists of an On/Off fan component, a WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil component, a WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil component, and a Gas or Electric supplemental heating coil component. The source side (water) of the heat pump is connected to a condenser loop with a heat exchanger (ground heat exchanger or other type) or a plant loop with a heating source such as a boiler and a cooling source such as a chiller or cooling tower.  The diagram below shows the setup and connection of the heat pump for the source side and load side for a ground heat exchanger configuration. Note that on the load side, the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling coil must always be placed before the WaterToAirHeatPump heating coil.
For this zone heat pump,there are two types of WaterToAirHeatPump coil model allowed:

Zone Water to Air Heat Pump Schematic for a DrawThrough Configuration with Ground Heat Exchanger[fig:zone-water-to-air-heat-pump-schematic-for-a]
Inputs
Field: Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name for the zone system heat pump.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
This alpha field defines the name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the heat pump operates during a given time period. A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the heat pump must be off for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the heat pump is available to operate during that time period. This schedule may be used to completely disable the heat pump (all of its coils and the supply air fan) as required. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the name of the HVAC system node from which the heat pump draws its inlet air. This node must be a zone exhaust node as specified in aZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
This alpha field contains the name of the HVAC system node to which the heat pump sends its outlet air. This node must be a zone inlet node as specified in aZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject.
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Type
This field specifies the type of outdoor air mixer used by this WaterToAirHeatPump unit. The outdoor air mixer component is part of the WaterToAirHeatPump compound object. The only available outdoor air mixer type is:
OutdoorAir:Mixer
This input field should be left blank when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Name
This alpha field defines the name of an outdoor air mixer component which composes part of the zone WaterToAirHeatPump. The return air stream node of the outdoor air mixer should also be the same node as the air inlet node of the WaterToAirHeatPump. Furthermore, the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node should be the same as the WaterToAirHeatPump's fan inlet air node (for blow through fan placement) or the WaterToAirHeatPump's cooling coil inlet node (for draw through fan placement). This input field should be left blank when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject. If this field is left blank, an outdoor air mixer object is not simulated.
Field: Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: Heating Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than 0 or this field is autosizable.
Field: No Load Supply Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the supply air flow rate leaving the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. Values must be greater than or equal to zero, or this field is autosizable. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and this value is set to zero or this field is left blank, then the model assumes that the supply air flow rate when no cooling/heating is needed is equal to the supply air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation or heating operation).
Field: Cooling Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX cooling coil is operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outside air flow rate during cooling operation is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outside air flow rate during cooling operation cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air flow rate during cooling operation. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: Heating Outdoor Air Flow Rate
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when the DX heating coil and/or supplemental heater are operating. Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the outside air flow rate during heating operation is fixed; it cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the outside air flow rate during heating operation cannot be greater than the heat pump's supply air flow rate during heating operation. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.
Field: No Load Outdoor Air Flow Rate When No Cooling or Heating is Needed
This numeric field defines the outdoor air flow rate through the heat pump in cubic meters per second when neither cooling or heating is required (i.e., DX coils and supplemental heater are off but the supply air fan operates). Values must be greater than or equal to 0, or this field is autosizable. Note that the no load outdoor air flow rate cannot change during the simulation. In addition, the no load outdoor air flow rate cannot be greater than the heat pump's no load supply air flow rate. This field is only used when the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation. If the heat pump's supply air fan operating mode schedule specifies continuous fan operation and the field “No Load Supply Air Flow Rate” is set to zero or is left blank, then the model assumes that the no load outdoor air flow rate is equal to the outdoor air flow rate when the cooling or heating coil was last operating (for cooling operation [i.e., Cooling outdoor air flow rate] or heating operation [i.e., Heating outdoor air flow rate]) and this field is not used. This input field is set to zero flow when the WaterToAirHeatPump is connected to anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixerobject.

Field: Heat Pump Fan Delay Time
This numeric field contains the time delay in seconds for the heat pump supply air fan to shut off after compressor cycle off. This value can be obtained from the manufacturer or the heat pump catalog. Suggested value is 60 seconds. This value is disregared at times when the WaterToAirHeatPump's fan operating mode schedule value is greater than 0 (i.e., continuous fan mode).
Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type
This is the object type of the supplemental heating coil. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller orController:WaterCoilobject. The parent object(ZoneWater to Air Heat Pump) itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow. The valid choices are:
Coil:Heating:ElectricCoil:Heating:FuelCoil:Heating:WaterCoil:Heating:Steam
Coil:Heating:Electric
Coil:Heating:Fuel
Coil:Heating:Water
Coil:Heating:Steam
Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Name
This alpha field contains the identifying name given to the supplemental heating coil, and should match the name specified in the corresponding supplemental heating coil object.
Field: Maximum Supply Air Temperature from Supplemental Heater
This numeric field defines the maximum allowed supply air temperature exiting the heat pump supplemental heating coil in degrees Celsius. If this input field is left blank, the value defaults to autosize.
Field: Maximum Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature for Supplemental Heater Operation
This numeric field defines the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius above which the heat pump supplemental heating coil is disabled. The temperature for this input field must be less than or equal to 21°C. If this input field is left blank, the default value is 21°C.
Field: Outdoor Dry-Bulb Temperature Sensor Node Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the outdoor node which controls the operation of the supplemental heating coil. If this field is left blank, the outdoor temperature is based solely on the weather data. If this field is not blank, the node name specified must also be listed in anOutdoorAir:Nodeobject where the height of the node is taken into consideration when calculating outdoor temperature from the weather data. Alternately, the node name must be specified in anOutdoorAir:NodeListobject where the outdoor temperature is taken directly from the weather data.
Field: Fan Placement
This alpha field has two choices:BlowThroughorDrawThrough. The first choice represents a blow through system where the supply air fan is before the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. The second choice represents a draw through system where the supply fan is between the WaterToAirHeatPump cooling/heating coil and the supplementary heating coil. If this input field is left blank, the default is blow through.
Field: Supply Air Fan Operating Mode Schedule Name
This alpha field specifies the name of the supply air fan operating mode schedule. The supply air fan operating mode may vary during the simulation based on time-of-day or with a change of season. Schedule values of 0 denote that the supply air fan and the heating or cooling coil cycle on and off together to meet the heating or cooling load (a.k.a. AUTO fan). Schedule values other than 0 denote that the supply air fan runs continuously while the heating or cooling coil cycles to meet the load. If this field is left blank, the model assumes the supply air fan cycles with the heating or cooling coil throughout the simulation.
As shown in the example below, correct specifications of the WatertoAirHeatPump requires specification of the following objects in addition to theZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPumpobject:
On/Off fanWatertoAirHeatPump cooling coil (EquationFit only)WatertoAirHeatPump heating coil (EquationFit only)Supplementary heating coilOutdoor air mixerCondenser loop or plant loop demand branches
On/Off fan
WatertoAirHeatPump cooling coil (EquationFit only)
WatertoAirHeatPump heating coil (EquationFit only)
Supplementary heating coil
Outdoor air mixer
Condenser loop or plant loop demand branches
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this WatertoAirHeatPump or object's fan. If the WatertoAirHeatPump is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this WatertoAirHeatPump object should be on or off.
Field: Heat Pump Coil Water Flow Mode
This field specifies the way in which water flow through the heat pump coils will be modeled.  This field is only used when WatertoAirHeatPump:EquationFit coils are used. There are three options:
CyclingConstantCyclingOnDemand
Cycling
Constant
CyclingOnDemand
Cyclingvaries water flow through the coil based on the heat pump Part Load Ratio. This control method is appropriate for modeling heat pumps that are outfitted with a soleniod valve which allows water to flow through the coil only when the compressor is active. This is the default for EnergyPlus V8 and later.
Constantprovides a constant water flow regardless of heat pump operation. Remember that EnergyPlus has two coils (a heating coil and a cooling coil) to approximate the operation of one coil that can operate in either heating mode or cooling mode. Therefore, when the water flow mode is constant, there will be full flow through either the heating coil or the cooling coil, but not both at the same time.
ConstantOnDemandprovides full flow through the coil whenever there is a load. When there is no load, there is zero flow through the coil.  This control strategy represents the way EnergyPlus modeled heat pump water flow prior toVersion8.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name
This optional input field is the name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. The name must correspond to unique name of aDesignSpecification:ZoneHVAC:Sizingobject. A Design SepcificationZoneHVAC Sizing object defines scalable sizing methods for sizing input fields such as Cooling Supply Air Flow Rate in this Water To Air Heat Pump zone HVAC object. The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.

Zone Water to Air Heat Pump Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the zone water source heat pump  fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the zone water source heat pump  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:Dehumidifier:DX
This object can be used for modeling conventional mechanical dehumidifiers. These systems use a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil to cool and dehumidify an airstream. Heat from the DX system's condenser section is rejected into the cool/dehumidified airstream, resulting in warm dry air being supplied from the unit. In EnergyPlus, this object is modeled as a type of zone equipment (ref.ZoneHVAC:EquipmentListandZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Schematic of a mechanical dehumidifier[fig:schematic-of-a-mechanical-dehumidifier]
The model has inputs for water removal, energy factor and air flow rate at rated conditions (26.7°C, 60% RH). Curve objects must be specified to describe performance at off-rated conditions. A part-load cycling curve input must also be specified to account for inefficiencies due to cycling. Other inputs including minimum and maximum operating temperatures for dehumidifier operation, off-cycle parasitic load, and an input to direct the removed water to a storage tank.
The model assumes that this equipment dehumidifies and heats the air. If used in tandem with another system that cools and dehumidifies the zone air, then the zone dehumidifier should be specified as the lowest cooling priority in theZoneHVAC:EquipmentListobject for best control of zone temperature and humidity levels (e.g., if there are 3 pieces of equipment inZoneHVAC:EquipmentList,then the zone dehumidifier should have Cooling Priority = 3). With this zone equipment prioritization, the other cooling and dehumidification system would operate first to meet the temperature setpoint (and possibly meet the high humidity setpoint as well). If additional dehumidification is needed, then the zone dehumidifier would operate. The sensible heat generated by the dehumidifier is carried over to the zone air heat balance for the next HVAC time step.

A schedule value equal to 0 denotes that the dehumidifier will not operate for that time period. A value greater than 0 denotes that the dehumidifier is available to operate during that time period. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.

This numeric input is the full load water removal rate, in liters per day, at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7°C [80F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate” below). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
Field: Rated Energy Factor
This numeric input is the energy factor (liters of water removed per kWh of electricity consumed) at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7°C [80F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate” below). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
Field: Rated Air Flow Rate
This numeric input is the volumetric air flow rate through the dehumidifier, in, at rated conditions (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7°C [80F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity). This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
Field: Water Removal Curve Name
This alpha field defines the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of water removal as a function of the dry-bulb temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) of the air entering the dehumidifier. The output of this curve is multiplied by the Rated Water Removal to give the water removal of the dehumidifier at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures and relative humidity levels different from the rating point conditions). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7°C [80F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate” above).
Field: Energy Factor Curve Name
This alpha field defines the name of a biquadratic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of the energy factor as a function of the dry-bulb temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) of the air entering the dehumidifier. The output of this curve is multiplied by the Rated Energy Factor to give the energy factor of the dehumidifier at specific operating conditions (i.e., at temperatures and relative humidity levels different from the rating point conditions). The curve should be normalized to have the value of 1.0 at the rating point (air entering the dehumidifier at 26.7°C [80F] dry-bulb and 60% relative humidity, and air flow rate as defined by field “Rated Air Flow Rate” above).
Field: Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve Name
This alpha field defines the name of a quadratic or cubic performance curve (ref: Performance Curves) that parameterizes the variation of electrical power input to the dehumidifier as a function of the part load ratio (PLR, defined as the water removal load to be met (kg/s) divided by the dehumidifier's water removal rate (kg/s) at the current operating conditions). The part load fraction (PLF) correlation accounts for efficiency losses due to compressor cycling.
The part load fraction correlation should be normalized to a value of 1.0 when the part load ratio equals 1.0 (i.e., no efficiency losses when the dehumidifier runs continuously for the simulation timestep). For PLR values between 0 and 1 (0 < = PLR < 1), the following rules apply:
0.7 < = PLF < = 1.0   and   PLF > = PLR
If PLF < 0.7 a warning message is issued, the program resets the PLF value to 0.7, and the simulation proceeds. The runtime fraction of the dehumidifier is defined as PLR/PLF. If PLF < PLR, then a warning message is issued and the runtime fraction of the dehumidifier is set to 1.0.
Mechanical dehumidifier typically have long runtimes with minimal compressor cycling. So, a typical part load fraction correlation might be:
PLF = 0.95 + 0.05(PLR)
If the user wishes to model no efficiency degradation due to compressor cycling, the part load fraction correlation should be defined as follows:
PLF = 1.0 + 0.0(PLR)
Field: Minimum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation
This numeric field defines the minimum inlet air dry-bulb temperature for dehumidifier operation. The dehumidifier will not operate if the inlet air temperature is below this value. This input value must be less than the Maximum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation, and the default value is 10°C.
Field: Maximum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation
This numeric field defines the maximum inlet air dry-bulb temperature for dehumidifier operation. The dehumidifier will not operate if the inlet air temperature is above this value. This input value must be greater than the Minimum Dry-Bulb Temperature for Dehumidifier Operation, and the default value is 35°C.
Field: Off-Cycle Parasitic Electric Load
This numeric field contains the off-cycle parasitic electric power in Watts. This is the parasitic electric power consumed by controls or other electrical devices associated with the dehumidifier. This parasitic electric load is consumed whenever the dehumidifier is available to operate, but is not operating. The model assumed that this parasitic power contributes to heating the zone air (i.e., affects the zone air heat balance). The minimum value for this field is 0.0, and the default value is also 0.0 if this field is left blank.
Field: Condensate Collection Water Storage Tank Name
This field is optional. It is used to specify where condensate from the dehumidifier is collected. If blank or omitted, then any water (condensate) removed is discarded. Enter the name of a Water Storage Tank (ref.WaterUse:Storage)object defined elsewhere and the condensate will then be collected in that tank.

The condensate volume output is also added to a meter with Resource Type = OnSiteWater, End Use Key = Condensate, Group Key = System (ref.Output:Meterobjects).
ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator
TheZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator- stand alone energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is a single-zone HVAC component used for exhaust air heat recovery (Figure6). This compound object consists of 3 required components: a generic air-to-air heat exchanger (see object Heat Exchanger:Air to Air:Generic), a supply air fan, and an exhaust air fan (see objectFan:OnOff).
An optional controller (see objectZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller)may be used to simulate economizer (free cooling) operation, modify air flow rates based on high indoor humidity, or simulate a “push-button” type economizer controller.
ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator compound object Schematic[fig:zonehvac-energyrecoveryventilator-compound]
This compound object models the basic operation of supply and exhaust air fans and an air-to-air heat exchanger. The stand alone ERV operates whenever the unit is scheduled to be available (Availability schedule). The stand alone ERV object can be used in conjunction with an economizer feature whereby heat exchange is suspended whenever free cooling is available (i.e., air flow is fully bypassed around a fixed-plate heat exchanger or the rotation of a rotary heat exchanger is stopped). The economizer feature may also be activated based on a time-of-day schedule. Heat exchange is also suspended when air flow rates through the heat exchanger are modified in response to a zone humidistat. When an economizer is used in conjunction with high humidity control, high humidity control has the priority.
To model a stand alone ERV connected to a single zone, the input data file should include the following objects:
ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilatorHeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatentFan:OnOff(supply air)Fan:OnOff(exhaust air)ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator:Controller(if economizer [free cooling] mode or high humidity control operation is desired)ZoneControl:Humidistat(required for high humidity control option)SetpointManager:Scheduled(if supply air outlet temperature control is used, Ref.

Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the unit can operate during a given time period. A schedule value greater than 0 (usually 1 is used) indicates that the unit can operate during the time period. A value less than or equal to 0 (usually 0 is used) denotes that the unit will not operate. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods.
Field: Heat Exchanger Name

HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent
Field: Supply Air Flow Rate
The supply air flow rate through the ERV unit in cubic meters per second at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20°C drybulb). The program uses local barometric pressure to account for altitude using the equation for “standard atmospheric” pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m
Note that this flow rate must be within the valid air flow range for the heat exchanger (ref:HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatentin the Engineering Document). In addition, this flow rate must be less than or equal to the supply fan air flow rate(Fan:OnOff).If the supply air flow rate is less than the exhaust air flow rate, the zone infiltration (ref: ZoneInfiltration) should be specified accordingly (the infiltration induced by imbalanced air flows is not accounted for automatically). The ERV supply air flow rate may also be autosized using the ventilation rate per floor area and/or ventilation rate per occupant fields below. When autosizing, the heat exchanger and fan air flow rates should also be autosized.
Note: The supply air inlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be an outdoor air node (ref:OutdoorAir:NodeandOutdoorAir:NodeList).The supply air outlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be a zone air inlet node (ref:ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).
Field: Exhaust Air Flow Rate
The exhaust air flow rate through the ERV unit in cubic meters per second at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20°C drybulb). The program uses local barometric pressure to account for altitude using the equation for “standard atmospheric” pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559

Note that this flow rate must be within the valid air flow range for the heat exchanger (ref:HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatentin the Engineering Document). In addition, this flow rate must be less than or equal to the exhaust fan air flow rate(Fan:OnOff).If the exhaust air flow rate is greater than the supply air flow rate, the zone infiltration (ref: ZoneInfiltration) should be specified accordingly (the infiltration induced by imbalanced air flows is not accounted for automatically). The ERV exhaust air flow rate may also be autosized using the ventilation rate per floor area and/or ventilation rate per occupant fields below. When autosizing, the heat exchanger and fan air flow rates should also be autosized.
Note: The exhaust air inlet node specified in the generic heat exchanger object must be a zone air exhaust node (ref:ZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnections).

This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to this Stand Alone ERV  object's fan. If the Stand Alone ERV is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of this Stand Alone ERV  object should be on or off.

Zone Ventilator Supply Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of the Stand Alone ERV  fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in the Stand Alone ERV  object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List (with or without Hybrid Ventilation Manager), rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow
Terminal units with variable refrigerant flow compound HVAC object are used exclusively with variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioning systems (Ref.AirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlowobjects). The VRF terminal unit may be used as zone, air loop or outside air system equipment. The VRF terminal unit compound object contains an optional outdoor air mixer, a DX cooling coil, a DX heating coil, a supply fan (optional for air loop and outdoor air system equipment), and an optional supplemental heating coil object.
Note: The terminal unit may be used in the air loop and/or outdoor air system, however, at this time only constant flow (or limited variation within the limits allowed for DX coils) through the unit is allowed. Using a wide range of outdoor air flow rates will cause the DX coil model to fail. For example, if the minimum outdoor air flow rate is allowed to fall near 0, the DX coil model will calculate very low, even very negative, coil outlet temperatures. This can cause psychrometric warnings to occur and cause the simulation to end prematurely.
For zone equipment the terminal units are connected to a zone using the inlet and exhaust node names specified in aZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject. The zone exhaust node has the same name as the terminal unit air inlet node. The zone inlet node has the same name as the terminal unit air outlet node. The zone terminal unit is also listed in a zone's equipment list and will typically be the first equipment operating for both cooling and heating (i.e., Sequence = 1 in theZoneHVAC:EquipmentList).Other ZoneHVAC equipment may be used in the same zone and should be sequenced to operate after the zone terminal units (i.e., sequence = 2 or higher).
For air loop equipment and outdoor air system equipment the VRF terminal unit inlet and outlet nodes define the location of the system in the air loop and outdoor air system. The node names must define the path of the air stream in order from the beginning of the air loop or outdoor air system to the outlet of that system.
This VRF terminal unit can be controlled based on a load or set point. When the system is used as zone equipment, load control is always used. When the VRF terminal unit is used in an air loop and the control zone name or thermostat location is specified, the system is controlled based on zone load. If the control zone name or thermostat location is not specified the VRF terminal unit will be controlled based on termninal unit or coil outlet node set point temperature. When set point based control is used the node temperature set points may be placed at the outlet of the terminal unit or at individual coil outlet nodes. If the VRF terminal unit is used in an air loop's outdoor air system, control is always based on a termninal unit or coil outlet node temperature set point.
The terminal units operate to satisfy a heating or cooling load in a zone based on a zone thermostat temperature set point. A direct-expansion (DX) cooling and/or DX heating coil is specified depending on the operating mode required. Both a DX cooling and DX heating coil will typically be installed in the terminal unit, however only one may be used if desired. An optional supplemental heating coil can also be added to the terminal unit to provide additional heating when the main DX heating coil could not meet the entire heating load of a zone during cold outdoor conditions. The Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type must beCoil:Heating:Electric,Coil:Heating:Fuel,Coil:Heating:Water,orCoil:Heating:Steam.Outdoor ventilation air is modeled with the use of an optional outside air mixer object. Outside air may be provided to the zone only when the coil is operating or can be supplied continuously even when the coil is not operating.
A supply air fan can be modeled as either draw through or blow through. The supply air fan is required for zone equipment and optional for air loop and outdoor air system equipment. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must beFan:SystemModel,Fan:OnOff,orFan:ConstantVolumeifAirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlowis used to model the VRF outdoor unit. The Supply Air Fan Object Type must beFan:SystemModelorFan:VariableVolumeifAirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControlorAirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlow:FluidTemperatureControl:HRis used to model the VRF outdoor unit.

This alpha field has two choices:BlowThroughorDrawThrough. If this field is left blank, the default is blow through.
The first choice stands for “blow through fan”. This means that the unit consists of a fan followed by the DX coils. The fan “blows through” the cooling and heating coils. If an outside air mixer is used, the fan inlet connects to the outdoor air mixer's mixed air node. If an outdoor air mixer is not used, the fan inlet connects to the zone exhaust node. For this configuration, the fan outlet always connects to the DX cooling coil inlet node (or if a DX cooling coil is not used, the DX heating coil inlet node).
The second choice stands for “draw through fan”. This means that the unit consists of the DX coil(s) followed by a fan. The fan “draws air through” the DX coil(s). In this case the fan inlet always connects to the DX heating coil outlet node (or if a DX heating coil is not use, the DX cooling coil outlet node) and the fan outlet node always connects to the zone inlet node.
Field: Supply Air Fan Object Type
This choice field contains the identifying type of supply air fan specified for the furnace. Fan type must beFan:OnOff,Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:SystemModelorFan:VariableVolume.

TheFan:SystemModelmay be used to model either of these fan operating characteristics.
This field may be left blank when the VRF terminal unit is used as air loop or outdoor air system equipment.

If the VRF terminal unit is used as air loop equipment and this terminal unit's outdoor air flow rates are autosized then the autosized flow rates will be set to 0 when an outdoor air system is used in the air loop (refAirloopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem).
Field: Outdoor Air Mixer Object Name

Field: Zone Terminal Unit On Parasitic Electric Energy Use
This numeric field defines the parasitic electrical energy use of the zone terminal unit when either terminal unit coil is operating. When in cooling mode, this electric energy use is reported in a zone terminal unit cooling electric consumption output variable. When in heating mode, this electric energy use is reported in a zone terminal unit heating electric consumption output variable.
Field: Zone Terminal Unit Off Parasitic Electric Energy Use
This numeric field defines the parasitic electrical energy use of the zone terminal unit when the terminal unit coil(s) is not operating. When the previous mode was cooling, this electric energy use is reported in a zone terminal unit cooling electric consumption output variable. When the previous mode was heating, this electric energy use is reported in a zone terminal unit heating electric consumption output variable.
Field: Rated Total Heating Capacity Sizing Ratio
This numeric field defines the ratio of the heating coil to cooling coil size when autosizing is used. The model assumes that when used, this value will be greater than 1. This field supersedes the Rated Total Heating Capacity Sizing Ratio entered in theAirConditioner:VariableRefrigerantFlowobject. If this field is left blank, the value entered in the parent object is used for sizing. If neither field is used, the sizing ratio is assumed to be 1.
Field: Availability Manager List Name
This optional input field is the name of anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject. An Availability Manager Assignment List is a list of Availability Managers giving both Availability Manager type and name. The availability managers in the list apply to thisZoneTerminal Unit object's fan. If theZoneTerminal Unit is available (per the Availability Schedule Name input field above) and this input field has a valid availability manager assignment list name, then the availability managers in the list determine when and if the fan of thisZoneTerminal Unit object should be on or off.
Field: Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing Object Name

The scaled Supply Air Flow Rate in turn is used to size cooling and heating capacity of the unit.
Field: Supplemental Heating Coil Object Type
This alpha field defines the type of supplemental heating coil to be used by this VRF terminal unit. The input requirements for these heating coil objects are described elsewhere in this document. The hot water and steam heating coils require specifying plant loop, branches, and connector objects to support the heating coils, and are placed on the demand side of the plantloop. The hot water flow modulation through the supplemental heating coil does not require additional controller orController:WaterCoilobject. The parent object (VRF terminal unit) itself provides the “controller” function of modulating water flow.

This numeric field defines the maximum outdoor dry-bulb temperature in degrees Celsius for this VRF terminal unit supplemental heating coil operation. The supplemental heater will not operate when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is above this value. The maximum value must be less than or equal to 21°C. If this field is left blank, the default value of 21°C will be used.
Field: Controlling Zone or Thermostat Location
This alpha field is only used when this VRF terminal unit is used as air loop equipment with load based operational control. When the terminal unit is used in an air loop and this terminal unit is load controlled, this zone's thermostat will control operation. When this terminal unit is used in an air loop and is set point controlled, this field must be blank (i.e., when the controlling zone name is present the system will be load controlled).

Zone VRF Air Terminal Fan Availability Status []
This is the availability status of theZoneTerminal Unit fan. This status flag is a result of the calculations made by the Availability Manager(s) listed in anAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListobject and/or calculations made by Hybrid Ventilation Manager object. TheAvailabilityManagerAssignmentListis an optional input in theZoneTerminal Unit object. When a single availability manager is used in an Availability Manager Assignment List, this is also the availability status reported by the specific availability manager (Ref. AvailabilityManager:* Outputs). For multiple availability managers in an Availability Manager Assignment List along with Hybrid Ventilation Manager, rules to determine fan availability status are described in the section ‘Group - System Availability Managers'. The control status outputs are represented using integers 0 through 3. These integers represent NoAction (0), ForceOff (1), CycleOn (2), and CycleOnZoneFansOnly (3). Since the status output is averaged, the output result may not correspond to the values described here when output variable frequencies other than detailed are used. Use the “detailed” reporting frequency (Ref.Output:Variableobject) to view the availability status at each simulation timestep.
ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC
ZoneHVAC:Hybrid UnitaryHVAC is a black-box model for packaged forced air equipment with multiple discrete operating modes. Generally, a “hybrid” is any system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior - a system that can both flow (as could be described by a differential equation) and jump (as must be described by distinct modes). Equipment in this category may utilize a wide variety technologies including, but not limited to: indirect evaporative cooling, desiccant dehumidification, heat recovery, vapor compression, adsorption, or ventilation cooling. Each hybrid system packages multiple technologies into a single integrated system. There are a multitude of unique hybrid system architectures, and each unique system may have numerous unique operating modes.
Schematic of object links for ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC[fig:hybrid001]
ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVACis a black-box model designed to allow empirical representation of a wide variety of hybrid unitary systems. The model does not require information about internal system architecture, however it requires extensive data to describe the performance of a product in every operating mode. The model is intended for packed forced air equipment and can represent unitary systems that consume electricity, water, and up to two additional fuel types.
Uncontrolled independent variables include outdoor and indoor air temperature and humidity ratio. Controlled independent variables include: operating mode, supply air flow rate, outdoor air fraction, and part runtime fraction. Dependent variables include supply air temperature, supply air humidity, electricity use, fuel uses, water use, fan electricity use, and external static pressure. Empirical data tables (seeTable:Lookup)are required to map each dependent variable in each discrete operating mode. The model can accommodate up to 26 discrete operating modes, including a standby mode. Each mode is limited to operate within independently specified ranges of indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions. The standby mode is not limited by either indoor or outdoor psychrometric conditions.
Schematic explanation of the architecture and function of ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVAC[fig:hybrid002]
ZoneHVAC:HybridUnitaryHVACis structured as a constrained optimization problem - in each time step the model will choose one or more combinations of the controlled independent variables so as to best provide the predicted sensible load, the predicted latent load, and the scheduled zone ventilation requirement, with the least amount of resource consumption.
A setting is defined as any unique combination of mode, outdoor air fraction, and supply air flow rate. The system may operate with multiple settings in each time step. The portion of each time step spent in a setting is described as the part runtime fraction for that setting. During any time step that the combination of settings can satisfy all of the soft constraints with part runtime fractions that sum to less than one, the system will operate in a standby mode (Mode 0) for the remainder of the timestep. If no combination of settings will satisfy all of the soft constraints the system will choose the combination of settings that most nearly satisfies all soft constraints. If the indoor and outdoor psychrometric conditions are beyond the constraints that limit each operating mode, or if no setting will satisfy all constraints on supply air temperature and absolute humidity, the system will operate in standby mode (Mode 0).

Field: System Maximum Supply Air Volume Flow Rate
This numeric input field specifies the maximum standard density supply air volume flow rate among all operating modes. The field allows custom resizing of the hybrid unit. The values specified in eachTable:Lookupobject associated with a hybrid unit represent performance data for a specific product of a particular size, but the value output from eachTable:Lookupobject is augmented by a normalization reference (Ref: Group - Performance TablesTable:Lookup).The normalization reference specified for allTable:Lookupobjects associated with a hybrid unit should be the maximum supply air mass flow rate for the real hybrid unit that was used to create the performance data included in each table object. The value in this field is used to rescale the normalized values output from tables for extensive dependent variables. If the standard density supply air volume flow rate input to this field is equivalent to the system maximum supply air mass flow rate used as the normalization reference - given appropriate unit conversions - then the resulting output from the model will exactly match the original performance data specified in each table. If the value in this field is larger or smaller, the values for extensive dependent variables will be scaled proportionally. The values of intensive dependent variables are rescaled by the normalization reference value, so will always match the original performance data specified in each table object.
