Group - Surface Construction Elements
This group of objects describes the physical properties and configuration for the building envelope and interior elements. That is, the walls, roofs, floors, windows, doors for the building.
Specifying the Building Envelope
Buildingelement constructions in EnergyPlus are built from the basic thermal and other material property parameters in physical constructions. Materials are specified by types  and named. Constructions are defined by the composition of materials. Finally, surfaces are specified for the building with geometric coordinates as well as referenced constructions.
Material and Material Properties
There are several material “types” which may be used to describe layers within opaque construction elements. The choice of which of these types to use is left up to the user. However, some guidance as to which material type to use is appropriate before describing each in detail. The opaque types are:
MaterialMaterial:NoMassMaterial:AirGapMaterial:RoofVegetationMaterial:InfraredTransparent
Material
Material:NoMass
Material:AirGap
Material:RoofVegetation
Material:InfraredTransparent
Materialis the “preferred” type of material. This requires knowledge of many of the thermal properties of the material, but it allows EnergyPlus to take into account the thermal mass of the material and thus allows the evaluation of transient conduction effects.Material:NoMassis similar in nature but only requires the thermal resistance (R-value) rather than the thickness, thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat. Note that using a simple R-value only material forces EnergyPlus to assume steady state heat conduction through this material layer. Finally,Material:AirGapshould only be used for an air gap between other layers in a construction. This type assumes that air is sufficiently lightweight to require only an R-value. In addition, since it is not exposed to any external environment, surface properties such as absorptance are not necessary.Material:RoofVegetationis used to help model “green roofs”.Material:InfraredTransparentis used similarly to the NoMass materials. Each of these materials is described in more detail below.
There are several material additions that can be made to the basic material properties. These additional material types are:

MaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:Suction
MaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:ThermalConductivity
MaterialProperty:PhaseChange
MaterialProperty:PhaseChangeHysteresis
These material property objects are used in conjunction with the basic material specification and reference back to the name of the basic material type. Without the basic material type specified the program, will give a severe error and terminate. For example, specifying the moisture materials and changing theHeatBalanceAlgorithmto a moisture simulation will allow the moisture simulation to take place.
Material
This definition should be used when the four main thermal properties (thickness, conductivity, density, and specific heat) of the material are known. This syntax is used to describe opaque construction elements only.
When aMaterialis used for theConstructionof a building surface, care should be taken to not attempt to model assemblies that were not included in the intended scope of applicability for the underlying heat transfer models.  The building surface models are for normal applications to building energy efficiency where the main focus is on assemblies with some thermal resistance. Extremely thin and/or highly conductive material layers should be neglected from theConstructionrather than included because they will not contribute to the assembly's overall thermal resistance or heat capacity. For some cases, thin and/or highly conductive materials are a serious problem for the heat transfer modeling and the values for thickness, conductivity, density and specific heat are checked for appropriateness. This check calculates the Material's thermal diffusivity from the inputs for conductivity, density, and specific heat and compares it to a maximum threshold of(m/s). If the diffusivity is above this threshold, then the program checks if the layer is sufficiently thick and may issue a warning if it is too thin and highly conductive.
The absorptance values in this object impart surface properties to the construction and should be applied to the thermally significant inner and outer layers in the overall assembly.  Attempting to trick the program by modeling thin “paint” layers to apply surface properties is not a good idea; the models were not intended to support such strategies.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a unique reference name that the user assigns to a particular material. This name can then be referred to by other input data (ref:Constructionobject).
Field: Roughness
This alpha field defines the relative roughness of a particular material layer. This parameter only influences the convection coefficients, more specifically the exterior convection coefficient. A special keyword is expected in this field with the options being “VeryRough”, “Rough”, “MediumRough”, “MediumSmooth”, “Smooth”, and “VerySmooth” in order of roughest to smoothest options.
Field: Thickness
This field characterizes the thickness of the material layer in meters. This should be the dimension of the layer in the direction perpendicular to the main path of heat conduction. This value must be a positive.Modeling layers thinner (less) than 0.003 m is not recommended; rather, add those properties to one of the adjacent layers.
Field: Conductivity
This field is used to enter the thermal conductivity of the material layer. Units for this parameter are W/(m-K). Thermal conductivity must be greater than zero.Modeling layers with conductivity higher than 5.0 W/(m-K) is not recommended; however, this may be appropriate for non-surfaces such as pipes and TDDs (ref.DaylightingDevice:Tubularobject).
Field: Density
This field is used to enter the density of the material layer in units of kg/m. Density must be a positive quantity.In some cases textbooks and references may use g/m: be careful to not confuse units.
Field: Specific Heat
This field represents the specific heat of the material layer in units of J/(kg-K). Note that these units are most likely different than those reported in textbooks and references which tend to use kJ/(kg-K) or J/(g-K). They were chosen for internal consistency within EnergyPlus.Only values of specific heat of 100 or larger are allowed. Typical ranges are from 800 to 2000 J/(kg-K).
Field: Thermal Absorptance
The thermal absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident long wavelength (>2.5 microns) radiation that is absorbed by the material. This parameter is used when calculating the long wavelength radiant exchange between various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate). For long wavelength radiant exchange, thermal emissivity and thermal emittance are equal to thermal absorptance. Values for this field must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (with 1.0 representing “black body” conditions). The default value for this field is 0.9.
Field: Solar Absorptance
The solar absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident  solar radiation that is absorbed by the material. Solar radiation (0.3 to 2.537) includes the visible spectrum as well as infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. This parameter is used when calculating the amount of incident solar radiation absorbed by various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate). If solar reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials). Values for this field must be between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value for this field is 0.7.
Field: Visible Absorptance
The visible absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident visible wavelength radiation that is absorbed by the material. Visible wavelength radiation (0.37 to 0.78weighted by photopic response) is slightly different than solar radiation in that the visible band of wavelengths is much more narrow while solar radiation includes the visible spectrum as well as infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. This parameter is used when calculating the amount of incident visible radiation absorbed by various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate) as well as the daylighting calculations. If visible reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials). Values for this field must be between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value for this field is 0.7.

Material:InfraredTransparent
A Infrared Transparent surface is similar to a resistance-only surface.  The surface will actually participate in the transfer of visible and solar radiation by doing a wavelength transformation and making all short wave length radiation that is incident on the surface into long wave length radiation and having it participate in the long wavelength radiant exchange.Note the ConvectionCoefficient instructions that follow the Infrared Transparent construction object below.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field contains the unique name (across allMaterialobjects) for the Infrared Transparent material.
A Infrared Transparent surface should not participate in a convective/conductive exchange between the zones it separates.  In order to minimize this effect, the ConvectionCoefficients object must be used for the surfaces referencing the Infrared Transparent (IRT) construction.

Material:AirGap

MaterialProperty:MoisturePenetrationDepth:Settings
This material is used to describe the nine moisture material properties that are used in the EMPD (Effective Moisture Penetration Depth) heat balance solution algorithm. The EMPD algorithm is a simplified, lumped moisture model that simulates moisture storage and release from interior surfaces. The model uses convective mass transfer coefficients that are determined by existing heat and mass transfer relationships, e.g. the Lewis relation. The EMPD model includes two fictitious layers of material with uniform moisture content: a surface layer, which accounts for short-term moisture buffering, and a deep layer, which accounts for more slowly responding moisture buffering. The model calculates the moisture transfer between the air and the surface layer and between the surface layer and the deep layer. This moisture transfer impacts the zone humidity, and also impacts the zone temperature through latent-to-sensible conversion from the heat of adsorption.
This moisture model is used when the appropriate EMPD moisture materials are specified and the Solution Algorithm parameter is set to MoisturePenetrationDepthConductionTransferFunction.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a unique reference name that the user assigns to a particular material. This name can then be referred to by other input data (ref:Constructionobject).
Field: Water Vapor Diffusion Resistance Factor
The vapor diffusion resistance factor is the resistance to water vapor diffusionrelativeto the resistance to water vapor diffusion in stagnant air. In other words,equals 1 for air, and is generally greater than 1 for building materials.
The equation foris:

whereis the permeability of water vapor in air [kg/m-s-Pa], andis the permeability of water vapor in the material. The permeability of water vapor in air can be estimated as:

whereis the temperature [C] andthe ambient atmospheric pressure [Pa].
Fields: Moisture equilibrium constants
The next four fields, coefficientsa,b,c, andd, define the sorption isotherm curve used for building materials under equilibrium conditions. They define the relationship between the material's moisture content and the surface air relative humidity (ref: Effective Moisture Penetration Depth (EMPD) Model in the Engineering Reference):

where
= Coefficients to define the relationship between the material's moisture content and the surface air relative humidity;
= Moisture content defined as the mass fraction of water contained in a material, per mass of dry material [kg/kg];
= Surface air relative humidity [0 to 1].
Field: Surface Layer Penetration Depth
The Surface Layer Penetration Depth is the fictitious thickness of the surface layer in meters, and is used to calculate the volume of material that participates in short-term moisture transfer and storage. This layer has a uniform moisture content, and can be considered alumped-capacitance. The penetration depth is based on the amount of material that interacts with the zone air when subject to a cyclic relative humidity variation. It also impacts the mass transfer resistance between the zone air and this layer, with thinner depths resulting in lower mass transfer resistances (ref: Effective Moisture Penetration Depth (EMPD) Model in the Engineering Reference). For this reason very small values can lead to instabilities depending on the timestep.The surface penetration depth can be estimated with the following equation:

where
= water vapor permeability in the material, kg/m-s-Pa (see Vapor diffusion resistance factor above);
= saturated vapor pressure at some nominal temperature, Pa;
= cycle period of typical RH variations, s. 24 hours (86,400 s) is often used.
= dry density of material, kg/m;
= slope of moisture soprtion curve,.
If this field is left blank or set toautocalculate, the above equation will be used to calculate the surface layer penetration depth assuming aof 24 hours.
To use a period different than 24 hours, the equation above can be used to calculate the penetration depth based on a different value of. The penetration depth can also be entered as an empirical value, as inWoods and Winkler, 2016. If calculating, the assumed value ofshould not be less than 4x the simulation timestep to ensure an accurate and stable solution.
Field: Deep Layer Penetration Depth
The Deep Layer Penetration Depth is the fictitious thickness of the deep layer in meters, and is used to calculate the volume of material that participates in long-term moisture transfer and storage. This layer has a uniform moisture content, and can be considered alumped-capacitance. The deep penetration depth is based on the amount of material that interacts with the surface layer when subject to cyclic relative humidity variation. The deep penetration depth can be estimated with the following equation:

where each term is the same as the surface layer, except that the cycle period is different. This is usually on the order of weeks for the deep layer.
If this field is left blank or set toautocalculate, the above equation will be used to calculate the deep layer penetration depth assuming aof three weeks. To use a period different than 3 weeks, the equation above can be used to calculate the penetration depth based on a different value of. The penetration depth can also be entered as an empirical value, as inWoods and Winkler, 2016.
Field: Coating Layer Thickness
The Coating Layer Thickness (in meters) adds an additional resistance between the surface layer and the zone and represents a thin coating, such as paint, plaster, or other wall coverings.
This input is optional, and an input of zero implies no coating.
Field: Coating Layer Water Vapor Diffusion Resistance Factor
The vapor diffusion resistance factor of the coating is the coating's resistance to water vapor diffusionrelativeto the resistance to water vapor diffusion in stagnant air (see Vapor diffusion resistance factor section above).
This input is optional, and an input of zero implies no coating.

Advanced/Research Usage:This material is used to describe the temperature dependent material properties that are used in the Conduction Finite Difference solution algorithm. This conduction model is done when the appropriate materials are specified and the Solution Algorithm parameter is set toConductionFiniteDifference. This permits simulating temperature dependent thermal conductivity and phase change materials (PCM) in EnergyPlus.

This field is a regular material name specifying the material with which this additional temperature dependent property information will be associated.
Field: Temperature Coefficient for Thermal Conductivity
This field is used to enter the temperature dependent coefficient for thermal conductivity of the material.  Units for this parameter are (W/(m-K). This is the thermal conductivity change per unit temperature excursion from 20 C. The conductivity value at 20 C is the one specified with the basic material properties of the regular material specified in the name field. The thermal conductivity is obtained from:

where:
kis the 20C value of thermal conductivity(normal idf  input);
kis the change in conductivity per degree temperature difference from 20C;
Field Set: Temperature-Enthalpy
The temperature-enthalpy set of inputs specify a two column tabular temperature-enthalpy function for the basic material. Sixteen pairs can be specified. Specify only the number of pairs necessary. The tabular function must cover the entire temperature range that will be seen by the material in the simulation. It is suggested that the function start at a low temperature, and extend to 100C. Note that the function has no negative slopes and the lowest slope that will occur is the base material specific heat. Temperature values should be strictly increasing. Enthalpy contributions of the phase change are always added to the enthalpy that would result from a constant specific heat base material. An example of a simple Enthalpy Temperature function is shown below.

MaterialProperty:PhaseChangeHysteresis
This object is used to describe an advanced level of physics belonging to phase change materials used in building envelopes. The base phase change input object describes a single process curve whereby a material moves from a crystallized to liquid state and back. This input object adds a hysteresis effect, allowing the melting/freezing process to follow different curves, representing an effect that is commonly seen in actual building envelope phase change material applications.
This object also allows users to enter characteristic properties of the processes instead of a detailed temperature/enthalpy curve, making it more amenable for studies in which the user does not have the detailed test data required to generate the temperature/enthalpy curve. For more information on the use of phase change materials (PCM) with hysteresis, see the Conduction Finite Difference Solution Algorithm section of the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference document.
Inputs
TheMaterialProperty:PhaseChangeHysteresisobject includes the following inputs. For the characteristic curve properties, see the engineering reference.
Field: Name
This input must match the name of a material defined elsewhere within EnergyPlus. The thermal properties of that material are then overridden by the properties defined in this object.
Field: Latent Heat during the Entire Phase Change Process
This is the total amount of latent heat absorbed or discharged during the transition from solid to liquid or back, in Joules. The shapes of the enthalpy curves differ based on direction, but the total amount of energy from one state to the other does not.
Field: Liquid State Thermal Conductivity
This is the constant thermal conductivity used while the material is fully liquid, in W/m-K.
Field: Liquid State Density
This is the constant density while the material is fully liquid, in kg/m3.
Field: Liquid State Specific Heat
This is the constant specific heat while the material is fully liquid, in J/kg-K.
Field: High Temperature Difference of Melting Curve
This is the width of the enthalpy/specific heat melting curve, on the high side of the peak melting temperature, in degree Celsius (technically it is “change in Celsius”).
Field: Peak Melting Temperature
This is the center (peak) of the melting curve, in Celsius.
Field: Low Temperature Difference of Melting Curve
This is the width of the enthalpy/specific heat melting curve, on the low side of the peak melting temperature, in Celsius (technically it is “change in Celsius”).
Field: Solid State Thermal Conductivity
This is the constant thermal conductivity used while the material is fully solid, in W/m-K.
Field: Solid State Density
This is the constant density while the material is fully solid, in kg/m3.
Field: Solid State Specific Heat
This is the constant specific heat while the material is fully crystallized, in J/kg-K.
Field: High Temperature Difference of Freezing Curve
This is the width of the enthalpy/specific heat freezing curve, on the high side of the peak freezing temperature, in Celsius (technically it is “change in Celsius”).
Field: Peak Freezing Temperature
This is the center (peak) of the freezing curve, in Celsius. This will generally be lower than the peak melting temperature based on empirical data. Note, however, that EnergyPlus does allow users to specify a peak freezing temperature that is higher than the peak melting temperature.
Field: Low Temperature Difference of Freezing Curve
This is the width of the enthalpy/specific heat freezing curve, on the low side of the peak freezing temperature, in Celsius (technically it is “change in Celsius”).

MaterialProperty:VariableAbsorptance
This object is used to describe a dynamic coating material applied on the outside of opaque exterior walls or roofs. The object will modify the thermal or solar absorptance of the outside surface of an existing material defined in the field “ReferenceMaterialName”. The variation of the thermal or solar absorptance of the coating can be driven by any of the following four control variables: surface temperature, surface received solar radiation, zone heating/cooling mode, or a schedule. If both the thermal and the solar absorptance are varying, the control signals are assumed to be the same, but different functions/schedules are allowed. The material can have a variable thermal absorptance and a constant solar absorptance, or a constant thermal absorptance and a variable solar absorptance. Note that the variable-absorptance coatings modeled with this object are not exactly equivalent to those modeled with EMS. This object only adjusts the thermal or solar absorptance of the exterior surfaces, while the EMS approach overwrites the absorptance of both the interior and exterior surfaces.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the variable absorptance material property object.
Field: Reference Material Name
This field is a regular material name specifying the material with which this additional variable absorptance property information will be associated.
Field: Control Signal
It can be one of the following: surface temperature, surface received solar radiation, zone heating/cooling mode, or a schedule. If the control signal is “Scheduled”, then a schedule needs to be specified in “Thermal Absorptance Schedule Name” or “Solar Absorptance Schedule Name”. The schedule value will override the material absorptance value. If the control signal is not “Scheduled”, then the control signal value at the target surface or zone will decide the absorptance, based on the function referenced in “Thermal Absorptance Function Name” or “Solar Absorptance Function Name”. If not specified, the control signal will assumed to be surface temperature.
Field: Thermal Absorptance Function Name
The name of a Curve or aTable:Lookupobject describing the relationship between the control signal and the thermal absorptance.
Field: Thermal Absorptance Schedule Name
The name of a Schedule object that overwrites the material thermal absorptance. If neither this field or the previous field are defined, then the thermal absorptance is assumed to be constant
Field: Solar Absorptance Function Name
The name of a Curve or aTable:Lookupobject describing the relationship between the control signal and the solar absorptance.
Field: Solar Absorptance Schedule Name
The name of a Schedule object that overwrites the material solar absorptance. If neither this field or the previous field are defined, then the solar absorptance is assumed to be constant
MaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:Settings
Advanced/Research Usage:This object is used to describe two of the seven additional material properties needed for the CombinedHeatAndMoistureFiniteElement heat balance solution algorithm. The settings object is used when the solutions algorithm is set to CombinedHeatAndMoistureFiniteElement and the appropriate material properties are assigned to each material. This permits the simulation of the moisture dependent thermal properties of the material as well as the transfer of moisture through, into and out of the material into the zone or exterior.
In addition to the Porosity and Initial Water content properties described here, five additional properties, described by tabulated relationships between variables, are required. These properties are;

All materials in a construction are required to have all material properties defined for HAMT to work.
Within theMaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:Settingsobject the following fields are defined.
Inputs
Field: Material Name
This field is a unique reference name that the user assigns to a particular material. This name can then be referred to by other input data.
Field: Porosity
The porosity of a material is the maximum fraction, by volume, of a material that can be taken up with water. The units are [m3/m3].
Field: Initial Water Content Ratio
For this solution algorithm, the initial water content is assumed to be distributed evenly through the depth of the material. The units are [kg/kg].
Below is an example input for the porosity and initial water content of a material.
MaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:Settings,
        Concrete,     !- Name
        0.76,     !- Porosity
        0.2;     !- Initial (or typical) Water content
MaterialProperty:HeatAndMoistureTransfer:SorptionIsotherm
Advanced/Research Usage:This material property is used in conjunction with the CombinedHeatAndMoistureFiniteElement heat balance solution algorithm.
The Isotherm data relates the moisture, or water content [kg/m3] of a material with the relative humidity (RH). The water content is expected to increase as relative humidity increases, starting at zero content at 0.0 relative humidity fraction and reaching a maximum, defined by the porosity, at 1.0 relative humidity fraction, which corresponds to 100% relative humidity. Relative humidities are entered as fraction for this object ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. These two extremes (0.0 and 1.0) are automatically set by the HAMT solution. However, if they are entered they will be used as extra data points. Data should be provided with increasing RH and moisture content up to as high an RH as possible to provide a stable solution. One possible reason for the following error message may be that a material has a very rapid increase in water content for a small change in RH, which can happen if the last entered water content point is at a low RH and the material has a very high porosity.
** Warning ** HeatAndMoistureTransfer: Large Latent Heat for Surface ROOF
Another potential reason for this error being generated is the use of inappropriate values for Vapor Transfer Coefficients. See theSurfaceProperties:VaporCoefficientsobject in the Advanced Surface Concepts group.

HAMT automatically assigns cells to construction objects so that there are more cells closer to boundaries between materials and also at the “surfaces” of the surface. It is not possible for users to define their own cells.
Each surface is made from a particular construction. The construction-surface relationship is output by HAMT to the eplusout.eio file with the following format.

Materials for Glass Windows and Doors
All the materials for glass windows and doors have the prefix “WindowMaterial”. The following  WindowMaterial descriptions (Glazing, Glazing:RefractionExtinctionMethod, Gas, GasMixture, Shade, Screen and Blind) apply to glass windows and doors. The property definitions described herein for Glazing, Gas and GasMixture are supported by the National Fenestration Rating Council as standard.
“Front side” is the side of the layer opposite the zone in which the window is defined. “Back side” is the side closest to the zone in which the window is defined. Therefore, for exterior windows, “front side” is the side closest to the outdoors. For interior windows, “front side” is the side closest to the zone adjacent to the zone in which the window is defined.
The solar radiation transmitted by the window layers enters the zone and is a component of the zone load. The solar radiation absorbed in each solid layer (glass, shade, screen or blind) participates in the window layer heat balance calculation. The visible transmittance and reflectance properties of the window are used in the daylighting calculation.
WindowMaterial:Glazing
In the following, for exterior windows, “front side” is the side of the glass closest to the outside air and “back side” is the side closest to the zone the window is defined in. For interzone windows, “front side” is the side closest to the zone adjacent to the zone the window is defined in and “back side” is the side closest to the zone the window is defined in.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the glass layer. It corresponds to a layer in a window construction.
Field: Optical Data Type
Valid values for this field are SpectralAverage, Spectral, SpectralAndAngle, and BSDF.
If Optical Data Type = SpectralAverage, the values you enter for solar transmittance and reflectance are assumed to be averaged over the solar spectrum, and the values you enter for visible transmittance and reflectance are assumed to be averaged over the solar spectrum and weighted by the response of  the human eye. There is an EnergyPlus Reference Data Set forWindowMaterial:Glazingthat contains spectral average properties for many different types of glass.
If Optical Data Type = Spectral, then, in the following field, you must enter the name of a spectral data set defined with the WindowGlassSpectralData object. In this case, the values of  solar and visible transmittance and reflectance in the fields below should be blank.
If Optical Data Type = SpectralAndAngle, then, in the last 3 fields, you must enter the name of a spectral and angle data set defined with a curve or table object with two independent variables. In this case, theWindowGlass Spectral Data Set Name should be blank, and the values of solar and visible transmittance and reflectance in the fields below should be blank.
If Optical Data Type = BSDF, theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject must be used to define the window construction layers. In this case, theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject contains references to the BSDF files which contain the optical properties of the Complex Fenestration layers.
Field: Window Glass Spectral Data Set Name
If Optical Data Type = Spectral, this is the name of a spectral data set defined with a WindowGlassSpectralData object.
Field: Thickness
The surface-to-surface thickness of the glass (m).
Field: Solar Transmittance at Normal Incidence
Transmittance at normal incidence averaged over the solar spectrum. Used only when Optical Data Type = SpectralAverage.
For uncoated glass, when alternative optical properties are available-such as thickness, solar index of refraction, and solar extinction coefficient-they can be converted to equivalent solar transmittance and reflectance values using the equations given in“Glass Optical Properties Conversion.”
Field: Front Side Solar Reflectance at Normal Incidence
Front-side reflectance at normal incidence averaged over the solar spectrum. Used only when Optical Data Type = SpectralAverage.
Field: Back Side Solar Reflectance at Normal Incidence
Back-side reflectance at normal incidence averaged over the solar spectrum. Used only when Optical Data Type = SpectralAverage.
Field: Visible Transmittance at Normal Incidence
Transmittance at normal incidence averaged over the solar spectrum and weighted by the response of the human eye. Used only when Optical Data Type = SpectralAverage.
For uncoated glass, when alternative optical properties are available-such as thickness, visible index of refraction, and visible extinction coefficient-they can be converted to equivalent visible transmittance and reflectance values using the equations given in“Glass Optical Properties Conversion.”
Field: Front Side Visible Reflectance at Normal Incidence

Field: Back Side Visible Reflectance at Normal Incidence

Field: Infrared Transmittance at Normal Incidence
Long-wave transmittance at normal incidence.
Field: Front Side Infrared Hemispherical Emissivity
Front-side long-wave emissivity.
Field: Back Side Infrared Hemispherical Emissivity
Back-side long-wave emissivity.
Field: Conductivity
Thermal conductivity (W/m-K).
Field: Dirt Correction Factor for Solar and Visible Transmittance
This is a factor that corrects for the presence of dirt on the glass. The program multiplies the fields “Solar Transmittance at Normal Incidence” and “Visible Transmittance at Normal Incidence” by this factor if the material is used as theouterglass layer of anexteriorwindow or glass door.1If the material is used as an inner glass layer (in double glazing, for example), the dirt correction factor is not applied because inner glass layers are assumed to be clean. Using a material with dirt correction factor < 1.0 in the construction for an interior window will result in an error message.
Representative values of the dirt correction factor are shown in Table1.
The default value of the dirt correction factor is 1.0, which means the glass is clean.
It is assumed that dirt, if present, has no effect on the IR properties of the glass.
Field: Solar Diffusing
Takes values No (the default) and Yes. If No, the glass istransparentand beam solar radiation incident on the glass is transmitted as beam radiation with no diffuse component. If Yes, the glass istranslucentand beam solar radiation incident on the glass is transmitted as hemispherically diffuse radiation with no beam component.2See Figure2. Solar Diffusing = Yes should only be used on theinnermostpane of glass in an exterior window; it does not apply to interior windows.
For both Solar Diffusing = No and Yes, beam is reflected as beam with no diffuse component (see Figure2). Solar Diffusing cannot be used withWindowShading Control devices (except Switchable Glazing). When attempted, the window property will be set to No for Solar Diffusing. The Surface Details report will reflect the override.
If, in theBuildingobject, Solar Distribution = FullInteriorAndExterior, use of Solar Diffusing = Yes for glass in an exterior window will change the distribution of interior solar radiation from the window. The result is that beam solar radiation that would be transmitted by a transparent window and get absorbed by particular interior surfaces will be diffused by a translucent window and be spread over more interior surfaces. This can change the time dependence of heating and cooling loads in the zone.
In a zone with Daylighting:Detailed, translucent glazing-which is often used in skylights-will provide a more uniform daylight illuminance over the zone and will avoid patches of sunlight on the floor.
Comparison between transmittance properties of transparent glass (Solar Diffusing = No) and translucent glass (Solar Diffusing = Yes).[fig:comparison-between-transmittance-properties]
Field: Young's modulus
A measure of the stiffness of an elastic material.  It is defined as the ratio of the uniaxial stress over the uniaxial strain in the range of stress in which Hooke's Law holds. It is used only with complex fenestration systems defined through theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject. The default value for glass is 7.2<!-- -->{=html}10Pa.
Field: Poisson's ratio
The ratio, when a sample object is stretched, of the contraction or transverse strain (perpendicular to the applied load), to the extension or axial strain (in the direction of the applied load). This value is used only with complex fenestration systems defined through theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject. The default value for glass is 0.22.
Field: Window Glass Spectral and Incident Angle Transmittance Data Set Table Name
If Optical Data Type = SpectralAndAngle, this is the name of a spectral and angle data set of transmittance defined with a curve or table object with two independent variables. The first and second independent variables must be Angle, and Wavelength, respectively. The restriction is based on internal dataset use. Each dataset is divided into subsets for each incident angle internally.
Field: Window Glass Spectral and Incident Angle Front Reflectance Data Set Table Name
If Optical Data Type = SpectralAndAngle, this is the name of a spectral and angle data set of front reflectance defined with a curve or table object with two independent variables. The first and second independent variables must be Angle, and Wavelength, respectively. The restriction is based on internal dataset use. Each dataset is divided into subsets for each incident angle internally.
Field: Window Glass Spectral and Incident Angle Back Reflectance Data Set Table Name
If Optical Data Type = SpectralAndAngle, this is the name of a spectral and angle data set of back reflectance defined with a curve or table object with two independent variables. The first and second independent variables must be Angle, and Wavelength, respectively. The restriction is based on internal dataset use. Each dataset is divided into subsets for each incident angle internally.
It should be pointed out that when Optical Data Type = SpectralAndAngle for a glass layer in a construction, the table input data are converted into polynomial curve fits with 6 coefficients, so that all outputs of optical properties for the same construction will be curve values for a given incident angle. Therefore, the values may be slightly different from input values.

WindowMaterial:Glazing:RefractionExtinctionMethod
This is an alternative way of specifying glass properties. Index of refraction and extinction coefficient are given instead of the transmittance and reflectance values used inWindowMaterial:Glazing.However, unlikeWindowMaterial:Glazing,WindowMaterial:Glazing:RefractionExtinctionMethodis restricted to cases where the front and back optical properties of the glass are the same. This means it cannot be used for glass with a coating on one side. In that caseWindowMaterial:Glazingshould be used. Also, unlikeWindowMaterial:Glazing,WindowMaterial:Glazing:RefractionExtinctionMethoddoes not allow input of glass wavelength-by-wavelength (spectral) properties.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the glass layer. It corresponds to a layer in a window construction.
Field: Thickness
The surface-to-surface thickness of the glass (m).
Field: Solar Index of Refraction
Index of refraction averaged over the solar spectrum.
Field: Solar Extinction Coefficient
Extinction coefficient averaged over the solar spectrum (m).
Field: Visible Index of Refraction
Index of refraction averaged over the solar spectrum and weighted by the response of the human eye.
Field: Visible Extinction Coefficient
Extinction coefficient averaged over the solar spectrum and weighted by the response of the human eye (m).
Field: Infrared Transmittance at Normal Incidence
Long-wave transmittance at normal incidence.
Field: Infrared Hemispherical Emissivity
Long-wave hemispherical emissivity, assumed the same on both sides of the glass.
Field: Conductivity
Thermal conductivity (W/m-K).
Field: Dirt Correction Factor for Solar and Visible Transmittance
This is a factor that corrects for the presence of dirt on the glass. It multiplies the solar and visible transmittance at normal Incidence (which the program calculates from the input values of thickness, solar index of refraction, solar extinction coefficient, etc.) if the material is used as theouterglass layer of anexteriorwindow or glass door. If the material is used as an inner glass layer (in double glazing, for example), the dirt correction factor is not applied because inner glass layers are assumed to be clean. Using a material with dirt correction factor < 1.0 in the construction for an interior window will result in an error message.
Representative values of the direct correction factor are shown in Table1.
The default value of the dirt correction factor is 1.0, which means the glass is clean. It is assumed that dirt, if present, has no effect on the IR properties of the glass.
Field: Solar Diffusing
Takes values No (the default) and Yes. If No, the glass is transparent. If Yes, the glass is translucent and beam solar radiation incident on the glass is transmitted as hemispherically diffuse radiation with no beam component. (EnergyPlus does not model the “partially translucent” case in which beam solar radiation incident on the glass is transmitted as a combination of beam and diffuse.) Solar Diffusing = Yes should only be used on the innermost pane of glass in an exterior window; it does not apply to interior windows.
If, in theBuildingobject, Solar Distribution = FullInteriorAndExterior, use of Solar Diffusing = Yes for glass in an exterior window will change the distribution of interior solar radiation from the window. The result is that beam solar radiation that would be transmitted by a transparent window and get absorbed by particular interior surfaces will be diffused by a translucent window and be spread over more interior surfaces. This can change the time dependence of heating and cooling loads in the zone.
In a zone with Daylighting:Detailed, translucent glazing, which is often used in skylights, will provide a more uniform daylight illuminance over the zone and will avoid patches of sunlight on the floor.

Glass Optical Properties Conversion
Conversion from Glass Optical Properties Specified as Index of Refraction and Transmittance at Normal Incidence
The optical properties of uncoated glass are sometimes specified by index of refraction,, and transmittance at normal incidence,.
The following equations show how to convert from this set of values to the transmittance and reflectance values required byWindowMaterial:Glazing.These equations apply only touncoatedglass, and can be used to convert either spectral-average solar properties or spectral-average visible properties (in general,andare different for the solar and visible). Note that since the glass is uncoated, the front and back reflectances are the same and equal to thethat is solved for in the following equations.

Example:





WindowMaterial:GlazingGroup:Thermochromic
Thermochromic (TC) materials have active, reversible optical properties that vary with temperature. Thermochromic windows are adaptive window systems for incorporation into building envelopes. Thermochromic windows respond by absorbing sunlight and turning the sunlight energy into heat. As the thermochromic film warms it changes its light transmission level from less absorbing to more absorbing. The more sunlight it absorbs the lower the light level going through it. By using the suns own energy the window adapts based solely on the directness and amount of sunlight. Thermochromic materials will normally reduce optical transparency by absorption and/or reflection, and are specular (maintaining vision).
A thermochromic window is defined with aConstructionobject which references a special layer defined with aWindowMaterial:GlazingGroup:Thermochromicobject. TheWindowMaterial:GlazingGroup:Thermochromicobject further references a series ofWindowMaterial:Glazingobjects corresponding to each specification temperature of the TC layer.
This object specifies a layer of thermochromic glass, part of a thermochromic window. An example file ThermochromicWindow.idf is included in the EnergyPlus installation.

WindowMaterial:Gap
This input object is used to define the gap between two layers in a complex fenestration system, where theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject is used. It references the gas or gas mixtures defined in theWindowMaterial:GasandWindowMaterial:GasMixtureobjects. It is referenced as a layer in theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStateobject ;it cannot be referenced as a layer from theConstructionobject.
Inputs
Field: Name
Unique name of the gap.
Field: Thickness
The thickness (m) of the gap layer.
Field: Pressure
The pressure (Pa) of the gas in the gap layer, used to calculate the gas properties of the glazing system gap. The default value is one standard atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa). When modeling vacuum glazing, this value should represent the pressure in the evacuated glazing system. If this pressure is less that the ThermalModelParams:PressureLimit value, the the glazing system will be modeled as a vacuum glazing.
Field: Deflection State
This field is used when modeling the deflection of the glass layers in a window if theWindowThermalModel:Paramsvalue for “deflection model” is “MeasuredDeflection”.
Field: Support Pillar
References the support pillar of the gap layer if vacuum glazing is being modeled.  If left empty, then it is considered that gap layer does not have support pillars.
Field: Gas (or GasMixture)
References gas(WindowMaterial:Gas)or gas mixture(WindowMaterial:GasMixture)of the gap layer.

Inputs

WindowMaterial:SimpleGlazingSystem
This input object differs from the other WindowMaterial objects in that it describes an entire glazing system rather than individual layers. This object is used when only very limited information is available on the glazing layers or when specific performance levels are being targeted. The layer by layer description offers superior method of modeling windows that should be used instead of this object when sufficient data are available. This object accesses a model that turns simple performance indices into a fuller model of the glazing system.
The performance indices are U-factor and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient, and optionally Visible Transmittance. The values for these performance indices can be selected by the user to represent either glazing-only windows (with no frame) or an average window performance that includes the frame. Inside the program the model produces an equivalent window glazing layer with no frame. The properties of the modeled glazing layer are reported to the EIO file using the IDF input object syntax for theWindowMaterial:Glazinginput object. This equivalent layer could be reused in subsequent models if desired, however there will be important differences in the modeled window performance because the simple glazing system model includes its own special model for angular dependence when incident beam solar is not normal to the plane of the window.
When this object is referenced in aConstructionobject, it cannot be used with other glazing or gas material layers. Shades or blinds cannot be located between the glass, but these can be used on the inside or the outside of the glazing system.   If the glazing system does have between-the-glass shades or blinds, then the U and SHGC values entered in this object should include the impacts of those layers. Adding window treatment layers such as shades or screens will alter the overall performance to be different than the performance levels prescribed in this object.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the glazing system.  This value is unique across all constructions.
Field: U-Factor
This field describes the value for window system U-Factor, or overall heat transfer coefficient. Units are in W/m-K. This is the rated (NFRC) value for U-factor under winter heating conditions. The U-factor is assumed to be for vertically mounted products.
In versions up till 9.6.0, the maximum allowable input is U-7.0 W/m-K, and the effective upper limit of the glazing generated by the underlying model is around U-5.8 W/m-K. In later versions, such upper bound of the input U value is removed. So is the mismatch between the user input U and the effective U is resolved.
Field: Solar Heat Gain Coefficient
This field describes the value for SHGC, or solar heat gain coefficient. There are no units. This is the rated (NFRC) value for SHGC under summer cooling conditions and represents SHGC for normal incidence and vertical orientation.
Field: Visible Transmittance
This field is optional. If it is omitted, then the visible transmittance properties are taken from the solar properties. If it is included then the model includes it when developing properties for the glazing system. This is the rated (NFRC) value for visible transmittance at normal incidence.
An example of this object is as follows:

      SimpleWindow:DOUBLE PANE WINDOW , !- Name

      0.763 , !-  Solar Heat Gain Coefficient
      0.812 ; !-  Visible Transmittance
WindowMaterial:Shade
This object specifies the properties of window shade materials. Reflectance and emissivity properties are assumed to be the same on both sides of the shade. Shades are considered to be perfect diffusers (all transmitted and reflected radiation is hemispherically-diffuse) with transmittance and reflectance independent of angle of incidence. There is an EnergyPlus Reference Data Set forWindowMaterial:Shadethat contains properties of generic window shades.
Windowshades can be on the inside of the window (“interior shades”), on the outside of the window (“exterior shades”), or between glass layers (“between-glass shades”). When in place, the shade is assumed to cover all of the glazed part of the window, including dividers; it does not cover any of the window frame, if present. The plane of the shade is assumed to be parallel to the glazing.
WindowMaterial:Shadecan be used for diffusing materials such as drapery and translucent roller shades. For slat-type shading devices, like Venetian blinds, that have a strong angular dependence of transmission, absorption and reflection, it is better to useWindowMaterial:Blind.WindowMaterial:Screenshould be used to model wire mesh insect screens where the solar and visible transmission and reflection properties vary with the angle of incidence of solar radiation.
Transmittance and reflectance values for drapery material with different color and openness of weave can be obtained from manufacturers or determined from 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals, Chapter 30, Fig. 31.
There are two methods of assigning a shade to a window:
Inputs

1) Define the construction of the window without the shade, the so-called “bare” construction.2) Reference the bare construction in theFenestrationSurface:Detailedfor the window.3) Define theWindowMaterial:Shade.4) Define aWindowShadingControlfor the window in which you (a) specify that thisWindowMaterial:Shadeis the window's shading device and (b) specify how the shade is controlled.

Field: Conductivity
Shade material conductivity (W/m-K).
Field: Shade to Glass Distance
Distance from shade to adjacent glass (m). This is denoted bysin Figure4and Figure5, below. If the shade is not flat, such as for pleated pull-down shades or folded drapery, the average shade-to-glass distance should be used. (The shade-to-glass distance is used in calculating the natural convective air flow between glass and shade produced by buoyancy effects.) Not used for between-glass shades.

Field: Field: Air-Flow Permeability
The fraction of the shade surface that is open to air flow, i.e., the total area of openings (“holes”) in the shade surface divided by the shade area,HW. If air cannot pass through the shade material, Air-Flow Permeability = 0. For drapery fabric and screens the Air-Flow Permeability can be taken as the “openness” of the fabric (see 2001 ASHRAE Fundamentals, Chapter 30, Fig. 31), which is 0.0 to 0.07 for closed weave, 0.07 to 0.25 for semi-open weave, and 0.25 and higher for open weave.

WindowMaterial:Blind
This object specifies the properties of a window blind consisting of flat, equally-spaced slats. Unlike window shades, which are modeled as perfect diffusers, window blinds have solar and visible transmission and reflection properties that strongly depend on slat angle and angle of incidence of solar radiation. There is an EnergyPlus Reference Data Set forWindowMaterial:Blindthat contains properties of generic window blinds.
Blinds can be located on the inside of the window (“interior blinds”), on the outside of the window (“exterior blinds”), or between two layers of glass (“between-glass blinds”). When in place, the blind is assumed to cover all of the glazed part of the window, including dividers; it does not cover any of the window frame, if present. The plane of the blind is assumed to be parallel to the glazing. When the blind is retracted it is assumed to cover none of the window. The solar and thermal effects of the blind's support strings, tapes or rods are ignored. Slat curvature, if present, is ignored.
There are two methods of assigning a blind to a window:
Inputs
Method 1:
1) Define the construction of the window without the blind, the so-called “bare” construction.2) Reference the bare construction in theFenestrationSurface:Detailedfor the window.3) Define theWindowMaterial:Blind.4) Define aWindowShadingControlfor the window in which you (a) specify that thisWindowMaterial:Blindis the window's shading device and (b) specify how the blind is controlled.

Field: Name
Name of the blind. It is referenced as a layer in a window construction (ref:Constructionobject) or as a“MaterialName of Shading Device" in aWindowShadingControlobject.
Field: Slat Orientation
The choices are Horizontal and Vertical. “Horizontal” means the slats are parallel to the bottom of the window; this is the same as saying that the slats are parallel to the X-axis of the window. “Vertical” means the slats are parallel to Y-axis of the window.
Field: Slat Width
The width of the slat measured from edge to edge (m). See Figure6.
Field: Slat Separation
The distance between the front of a slat and the back of the adjacent slat (m). See Figure6.
Field: Slat Thickness
The distance between the faces of a slat (m). See Figure6.
Field: Slat Angle
The angle (degrees) between the glazing outward normal and the slat outward normal, where the outward normal points away from the front face of the slat (degrees). See Figure6.
If theWindowShadingControlfor the blind has Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = FixedSlatAngle, the slat angle is fixed at “Slat Angle.”
If Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = BlockBeamSolar, the program automatically adjusts the slat angle so as just block beam solar radiation. In this case the value of “Slat Angle” is used only when the blind is in place and there is no beam solar radiation incident on the blind.
If Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = ScheduledSlatAngle, the slat angle is variable. In this case “Slat Angle” is not applicable and the field should be blank.
If Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = FixedSlatAngle and “Slat Angle” is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum allowed by Slat Width, Slat Separation and Slat Thickness, the slat angle will be reset to the corresponding minimum or maximum and a warning will be issued.
Field: Slat Conductivity
The thermal conductivity of the slat (W/m-K).
Field: Slat Beam Solar Transmittance
The beam solar transmittance of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence on the slat. Any transmitted beam radiation is assumed to be 100% diffuse (i.e., slats are translucent).
Field: Front Side Slat Beam Solar Reflectance
The beam solar reflectance of the front side of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence (matte finish). This means that slats with a large specularly-reflective component (shiny slats) are not well modeled.
Field: Back Side Slat Beam Solar Reflectance
The beam solar reflectance of the back side of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence (matte finish). This means that slats with a large specularly-reflective component (shiny slats) are not well modeled.
Field: Slat Diffuse Solar Transmittance
The slat transmittance for hemispherically diffuse solar radiation. This value should equal “Slat Beam Solar Transmittance.”
Field: Front Side Slat Diffuse Solar Reflectance
The front-side slat reflectance for hemispherically diffuse solar radiation. This value should equal “Front Side Slat Beam Solar Reflectance.”
Field: Back Side Slat Diffuse Solar Reflectance
The back-side slat reflectance for hemispherically diffuse solar radiation. This value should equal “Back Side Slat Beam Solar Reflectance.”
Field: Slat Beam Visible Transmittance
The beam visible transmittance of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence on the slat. Any transmitted visible radiation is assumed to be 100% diffuse (i.e., slats are translucent).
Field: Front Side Slat Beam Visible Reflectance
The beam visible reflectance on the front side of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence (matte finish). This means that slats with a large specularly-reflective component (shiny slats) are not well modeled.
Field: Back Side Slat Beam Visible Reflectance
The beam visible reflectance on the front side of the slat, assumed to be independent of angle of incidence (matte finish). This means that slats with a large specularly-reflective component (shiny slats) are not well modeled.
Field: Slat Diffuse Visible Transmittance
The slat transmittance for hemispherically diffuse visible radiation. This value should equal “Slat Beam Visible Transmittance.”
Field: Front Side Slat Diffuse Visible Reflectance
The front-side slat reflectance for hemispherically diffuse visible radiation. This value should equal “Front Side Slat Beam Visible Reflectance.”
Field: Back Side Slat Diffuse Visible Reflectance
The back-side slat reflectance for hemispherically diffuse visible radiation. This value should equal “Back Side Slat Beam Visible Reflectance..”
Field: Slat Infrared Hemispherical Transmittance
The slat Infrared transmittance. It is zero for solid metallic, wooden or glass slats, but may be non-zero in some cases (e.g., thin plastic slats).
Field: Front Side Slat Infrared Hemispherical Emissivity
Front-side hemispherical emissivity of the slat. Approximately 0.9 for most materials. The most common exception is bare (unpainted) metal slats or slats finished with a metallic paint.
Field: Back Side Slat Infrared Hemispherical Emissivity
Back-side hemispherical emissivity of the slat. Approximately 0.9 for most materials. The most common exception is bare (unpainted) metal slats or slats finished with a metallic paint.
Field: Blind to Glass Distance
For interior and exterior blinds, the distance from the mid-plane of the blind to the adjacent glass (m). See Figure6. Not used for between-glass blinds. As for window shades (ref:WindowMaterial:Shade)this distance is used in calculating the natural convective air flow between glass and blind that is produced by buoyancy effects.
Opening Multipliers
The following opening multipliers are defined in the same way as for window shades (seeWindowMaterial:Shade,Figure4and Figure5). Note that, unlike window shades, there is no input for Air-Flow Permeability; this is automatically calculated by the program from slat angle, width and separation.
Field: Blind Top Opening Multiplier
Defined as for Material:WindowShade.
Field: Blind Bottom Opening Multiplier
Defined as for Material:WindowShade.
Field: Blind Left-Side Opening Multiplier
Defined as for Material:WindowShade.
Field: Blind Right-Side Opening Multiplier
Defined as for Material:WindowShade.
Field: Minimum Slat Angle
The minimum allowed slat angle (degrees). Used only ifWindowShadingControl(for the window that incorporates this blind) varies the slat angle (i.e., theWindowShadingControlhas Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = ScheduledSlatAngle or BlockBeamSolar). In this case, if the program tries to select a slat angle less than Minimum Slat Angle it will be reset to Minimum Slat Angle. (Note that if the Minimum Slat Angle itself is less than the minimum allowed by Slat Width, Slat Separation and Slat Thickness, it will be reset to that minimum.)
Field: Maximum Slat Angle
The maximum allowed slat angle (degrees). Used only ifWindowShadingControl(for the window that incorporates this blind) varies the slat angle (i.e., theWindowShadingControlhas Type of Slat Angle Control for Blinds = ScheduledSlatAngle or BlockBeamSolar). In this case, if the program tries to select a slat angle greater than Maximum Slat Angle the slat angle will be reset to Maximum Slat Angle. (Note that if the Maximum Slat Angle itself is greater than the maximum allowed by Slat Width, Slat Separation and Slat Thickness, it will be reset to that maximum.)

(a) Side view of a window blind with horizontal slats (or top view of blind with vertical slats) showing slat geometry. The front face of a slat is shown by a heavy line. The slat angle is defined as the angle between the glazing outward normal and the slat outward normal, where the outward normal points away from the front face of the slat. (b) Slat orientations for representative slat angles. The slat angle varies from 0, when the front of the slat is parallel to the glazing and faces toward the outdoors, to 90, when the slat is perpendicular to the glazing, to 180, when the front of the slat is parallel to the glazing and faces toward the indoors. The minimum and maximum slat angles are determined by the slat thickness, width and separation.[fig:a-side-view-of-a-window-blind-with-horizontal]

Field: Back Emissivity
The back emissivity of the shading layer. Minimum value: > 0. Maximum value: 1. Default: 0.90.
Field: Top Opening Multiplier
The top opening multiplier value will depend on the location of the shading device within the glazing system. There are several possible scenarios which can occur and they can be divided into two groups:
Shading device on the indoor/outdoor side of the window
In this case the opening multiplier is calculated as the smallest distance between the shading device and the frame (d), divided by the gap width (S). There are three possible cases for the position of a shading device the on indoor/outdoor side (see Figure7).
Three cases for the Dcalculation for an indoor/outdoor shade: Case a) A shading device between the frame; Case b) A shading device outside the frame, covering the frame; Case c) a shading device outside the frame, not covering the frame.[fig:three-cases-for-the-dp-calculation-for-an-indoor-outdoor-shade]
In the case where the distance between the frame and the shading device is bigger than the gap width, the dmultiplier is equal to one. Therefore, the calculation of the Dopening multiplier is:

Shading device between glass layers
In this case the opening multiplier is calculated as the smallest distance between the shading device and the frame or spacer (d), divided by the smaller gap width (the minimum of (SandS)).

This fraction is calculated as follows: Afront / (W * H), where Afront = Area of the front of the glazing system that is not covered by the shading system, W = the width of the glazing system (IGU) and H is height of the glazing system (IGU).

WindowMaterial:Screen
This object specifies the properties of exterior window screen materials. The window screen model assumes the screen is made up of intersecting orthogonally-crossed cylinders. The surface of the cylinders is assumed to be diffusely reflecting, having the optical properties of a Lambertian surface.
The beam solar radiation transmitted through a window screen varies with sun angle and is made up of two distinct elements: a direct beam component and a reflected beam component. The direct beam transmittance component is modeled using the geometry of the screen material and the incident angle of the sun to account for shadowing of the window by the screen material. The reflected beam component is an empirical model that accounts for the inward reflection of solar beam off the screen material surface. This component is both highly directional and small in magnitude compared to the direct beam transmittance component (except at higher incident angles, for which case the magnitude of the direct beam component is small or zero and the reflected beam component, though small in absolute terms can be many times larger than the direct beam component). For this reason, the reflected beam transmittance component calculated by the model can be a. disregarded, b. treated as an additive component to direct beam transmittance (and in the same direction), or c. treated as hemispherically-diffuse transmittance based on a user input to the model.
Direct beam and reflected beam transmittance components[fig:direct-beam-and-reflected-beam-transmittance]
The window screen “assembly” properties of overall beam solar reflectance and absorptance (including the screen material ‘cylinders' and open area) also change with sun angle and are calculated based on the values of the beam solar transmittance components (direct and reflected components described above) and the physical properties of the screen material (i.e., screen material diameter, spacing, and reflectance).
Transmittance, reflectance, and absorptance of diffuse solar radiation are considered constant values and apply to both the front and back surfaces of the screen. These properties are calculated by the model as an average value by integrating the screen's beam solar properties over a quarter hemisphere of incident radiation. Long-wave emissivity is also assumed to be the same for both sides of the screen.
There is an EnergyPlus Reference Data Set forWindowMaterial:Screenthat contains properties for generic window screens.Windowscreens of this type can only be used on the outside surface of the window (“exterior screens”). When in place, the screen is assumed to cover all of the glazed part of the window, including dividers; it does not cover any of the window frame, if present. The plane of the screen is assumed to be parallel to the glazing.
WindowMaterial:Screencan be used to model wire mesh insect screens where the solar and visible transmission and reflection properties vary with the angle of incidence of solar radiation. For diffusing materials such as drapery and translucent roller shades it is better to use theWindowMaterial:Shadeobject. For slat-type shading devices like Venetian blinds, which have solar and visible transmission and reflection properties that strongly depend on slat angle and angle of incidence of solar radiation, it is better to useWindowMaterial:Blind.
There are two methods of assigning a screen to a window:

Field: Name
Enter a unique name for the screen. This name is referenced as an outside layer in a window construction.
Field: Reflected Beam Transmittance Accounting Method
This input specifies the method used to account for screen-reflected beam solar radiation that is transmitted through the window screen (as opposed to being reflected back outside the building). Since this inward reflecting beam solar is highly directional and is not modeled in the direction of the actual reflection, the user is given the option of how to account for the directionality of this component of beam solar transmittance. Valid choices are DoNotModel, ModelAsDirectBeam (i.e., model as an additive component to direct solar beam and in the same direction), or ModelAsDiffuse (i.e., model as hemispherically-diffuse radiation). The default value is ModelAsDiffuse.
Field: Diffuse Solar Reflectance
This input specifies the solar reflectance (beam-to-diffuse) of the screen material itself (not the effective value for the overall screen “assembly” including open spaces between the screen material). The outgoing diffuse radiation is assumed to be Lambertian (distributed angularly according to Lambert's cosine law). The solar reflectance is assumed to be the same for both sides of the screen. This value must be from 0 to less than 1.0. In the absence of better information, the input value for diffuse solar reflectance should match the input value for diffuse visible reflectance.
Field: Diffuse Visible Reflectance
This input specifies the visible reflectance (beam-to-diffuse) of the screen material itself (not the effective value for the overall screen “assembly” including open spaces between the screen material) averaged over the solar spectrum and weighted by the response of the human eye. The outgoing diffuse radiation is assumed to be Lambertian (distributed angularly according to Lambert's cosine law). The visible reflectance is assumed to be the same for both sides of the screen. This value must be from 0 to less than 1.0.
If diffuse visible reflectance for the screen material is not available, then the following guidelines can be used to estimate this value:
Dark-colored screen (e.g., charcoal):                  0.08 - 0.10Medium-colored screen (e.g., gray):                   0.20 - 0.25Light-colored screen (e.g., bright aluminum):       0.60 - 0.65
Dark-colored screen (e.g., charcoal):                  0.08 - 0.10
Medium-colored screen (e.g., gray):                   0.20 - 0.25
Light-colored screen (e.g., bright aluminum):       0.60 - 0.65
Commercially-available gray scale or grayscale reflecting chart references can be purchased for improved accuracy in estimating visible reflectance (by visual comparison of screen reflected brightness with that of various known-reflectance portions of the grayscale).
Field: Thermal Hemispherical Emissivity
Long-wave emissivityof the screen material itself (not the effective value for the overall screen “assembly” including open spaces between the screen material). The emissivity is assumed to be the same for both sides of the screen.
For most non-metallic materials,is about 0.9. For metallic materials,is dependent on material, its surface condition, and temperature. Typical values for metallic materials range from 0.05-0.1 with lower values representing a more finished surface (e.g. low oxidation, polished surface).Materialemissivities may be found in Table 5 from the 2005 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, page 3.9. The value for this input field must be between 0 and 1, with a default value of 0.9 if this field is left blank.
Field: Conductivity
Screen material conductivity (W/m-K). This input value must be greater than 0. The default value is 221 W/m-K (aluminum).
Field: Screen Material Spacing
The spacing, S, of the screen material (m) is the distance from the center of one strand of screen to the center of the adjacent one. The spacing of the screen material is assumed to be the same in both directions (e.g., vertical and horizontal). This input value must be greater than the non-zero screen material diameter. If the spacing is different in the two directions, use the average of the two values.
Screen Material Spacing and Diameter[fig:screen-material-spacing-and-diameter]
Field: Screen Material Diameter
The diameter, D, of individual strands or wires of the screen material (m). The screen material diameter is assumed to be the same in both directions (e.g., vertical and horizontal). This input value must be greater than 0 and less than the screen material spacing. If the diameter is different in the two directions, use the average of the two values.
Field: Screen to Glass Distance
Distance from the window screen to the adjacent glass surface (m). If the screen is not flat, the average screen to glass distance should be used. The screen-to-glass distance is used in calculating the natural convective air flow between the glass and the screen produced by buoyancy effects. This input value must be from 0.001 m to 1 m, with a default value of 0.025 m if this field is left blank.
Field: Top Opening Multiplier
Effective area for air flow at the top of the screen divided by the horizontal area between the glass and screen (see the same field for the Material:WindowShade object for additional description). The opening multiplier fields can be used to simulate a shading material that is offset from the window frame. Since window screens are typically installed against the window frame, the default value is equal to 0.This input value can range from 0 to 1.
Field: Bottom Opening Multiplier
Effective area for air flow at the bottom of the screen divided the horizontal area between the glass and screen (see the same field for the Material:WindowShade object for additional description). The opening multiplier fields can be used to simulate a shading material that is offset from the window frame. Since window screens are typically installed against the window frame, the default value is equal to 0. This input value can range from 0 to 1.
Field: Left-Side Opening Multiplier
Effective area for air flow at the left side of the screen divided the vertical area between the glass and screen (see the same field for the Material:WindowShade object for additional description). The opening multiplier fields can be used to simulate a shading material that is offset from the window frame. Since window screens are typically installed against the window frame, the default value is equal to 0. This input value can range from 0 to 1.
Field: Right-Side Opening Multiplier
Effective area for air flow at the right side of the screen divided the vertical area between the glass and screen (see the same field for the Material:WindowShade object for additional description). The opening multiplier fields can be used to simulate a shading material that is offset from the window frame. Since window screens are typically installed against the window frame, the default value is equal to 0. This input value can range from 0 to 1.
Field: Angle of Resolution for Screen Transmittance Output Map
Angle of resolution, in degrees, for the overall screen beam transmittance (direct and reflected) output map. The comma-separated variable file eplusscreen.csv (Ref. OutputDetailsandExamples.pdf) will contain the direct beam and reflected beam solar radiation that is transmitted through the window screen as a function of incident sun angle (0 to 90 degrees relative solar azimuth and 0 to 90 degrees relative solar altitude) in sun angle increments specified by this input field. The default value is 0, which means no transmittance map is generated. Other valid choice inputs are 1, 2, 3 and 5 degrees.

WindowMaterial:Shade:EquivalentLayer
This object specifies the properties of Equivalent Layer window shade (roller blind) materials. Shades are considered to be thin, flat and perfect diffusers (all transmitted and reflected radiation is hemispherically-diffuse). However, shades can have beam-beam transmittance by virtue of their material openness.  The beam-beam transmittence is assumed to be the same for both sides of the shade and is the same as the openness area fraction. Beam-diffuse transmittance and reflectance, and emissivity properties can be different for front and back side of the shade.Window shades can be placed on the inside of the window, on the outside of the window, or between glass layers.WindowMaterial:Shade:EquivalentLayeris used for roller blinds. The off-normal solar property calculation of shades (roller blind) is based on a set of correlations developed from measurement of samples of commercially produced roller blind material with openness fraction less than 0.14. The model is not intended for materials with unusually high values of openness and should be limited to a maximum openness fraction of 0.20. The visible spectrum solar properties input fields are not used currently hence can be left blank. The equivalent layer window shade model does not supportWindowShadingControl.
Inputs

Assumed to be the same for front and back sides of the roller blinds.  The minimum value is 0.0 and maximum value is less than 1.0.  The default value is 0.0. For most common shade materials (e.g. Roller Blinds) the material oppeness fraction doesn't exceed 0.20.

WindowMaterial:Drape:EquivalentLayer
Specifies the optical and thermal properties of equivalent layer window drape fabric materials.
Drapery fabric shades are commonly placed on the the inside of the window. The long-wave (Thermal) properties for commonly used drapery fabrics are assumed to be the same on both sides but different values can be specified when required. Drape fabric shade layers are considered to be perfect diffusers (reflected radiation is hemispherically-diffuse independent of angle of incidence). Unpleated drape fabric is treated as thin and flat layer.The off-normal optical properties of drapery fabric is determined from user specified optical properties at normal incidence using empirical correlations. Pleated drape fabric requires entering the pleated section average width and length as shown in Figure13. For pleated drapes the effective beam-beam and beam-diffuse solar properties are determined by tracking both radiation components, for a given incident angle solar radiation, through various interactions with a fabric pleated in a rectangular geometry shown in Figure13.  The solar properties of the two different pleat facets are evaluated on the basis of the local solar incidence angle.  Therefore, the effective layer properties are influenced not just by horizontal solar profile angle, but also by incidence angle. The correlations used for drape fabrics optical property calculations reqiure that the solar absorptance of the fabric, at normal incidence, is not less than 1%. The equivalent layer window drapery fabric shade model does not supportWindowShadingControl.

WindowMaterial:Screen:EquivalentLayer
This object specifies the optical and thermal properties of exterior screen materials for Equivalent LayerWindow.Can only be placed on the exterior side of window construction. The window screen model assumes the screen is made up of intersecting orthogonally-crossed cylinders. The surface of the cylinders is assumed to be diffusely reflecting. The beam solar radiation transmitted through an equivalent Layer window screen varies with sun angle and is made up of two distinct elements: a beam-beam component and a beam-diffuse component. The beam-beam transmittance component is calculated using screen openness area fraction determined from the geometry of the screen and the incident angle of the sun. Empirical correlations are used to obtain the effective off-normal solar and longwave properties of insect screens.  Insect screen geometry is shown in Figure15.  The calculation of effective solar properties requires a set of properties measured at normal incidence. The equivalent layer window screen shade model does not supportWindowShadingControl.

Material:RoofVegetation
This definition must be used in order to simulate the green roof (ecoroof) model. The material becomes the outside layer in a green roof construction (see example below). In the initial release of the green roof model, only one material may be used as a green roof layer though, of course, several constructions using that material may be used. In addition, the model works only with the ConductionTransferFunction heat balance solution algorithm. This model was developed for low-sloped exterior surfaces (roofs). It is not recommended for high-sloped exterior surfaces (e.g., walls).
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a unique reference name that the user assigns to a particular ecoroof material. This name can then be referred to by other input data.
Field: Height of Plants
This field defines the height of plants in units of meters. This field is limited to values in the range 0.005 < Height < 1.00 m. Default is .2 m.
Field: Leaf Area Index
This is the projected leaf area per unit area of soil surface. This field is dimensionless and is limited to values in the range of 0.001 < LAI < 5.0. Default is 1.0. At the present time the fraction vegetation cover is calculated directly from LAI (Leaf Area Index) using an empirical relation. The user may find it necessary to increase the specified value of LAI in order to represent high fractional coverage of the surface by vegetation.
Field: Leaf Reflectivity
This field represents the fraction of incident solar radiation that is reflected by the individual leaf surfaces (albedo). Solar radiation includes the visible spectrum as well as infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. Values for this field must be between 0.05 and 0.5. Default is .22. Typical values are .18 to .25.
Field: Leaf Emissivity
This field is the ratio of thermal radiation emitted from leaf surfaces to that emitted by an ideal black body at the same temperature. This parameter is used when calculating the long wavelength radiant exchange at the leaf surfaces. Values for this field must be between 0.8 and 1.0 (with 1.0 representing “black body” conditions). Default is .95.
Field: Minimum Stomatal Resistance
This field represents the resistance of the plants to moisture transport. It has units of s/m. Plants with low values of stomatal resistance will result in higher evapotranspiration rates than plants with high resistance. Values for this field must be in the range of 50.0 to 300.0. Default is 180.
Field: Soil Layer Name
This field is a unique reference name that the user assigns to the soil layer for a particular ecoroof. This name can then be referred to by other input data. Default isGreenRoofSoil.
Field: Roughness
This alpha field defines the relative roughness of a particular material layer. This parameter only influences the convection coefficients, more specifically the exterior convection coefficient. A keyword is expected in this field with the options being “VeryRough”, “Rough”, “MediumRough”, “MediumSmooth”, “Smooth”, and “VerySmooth” in order of roughest to smoothest options. Default is MediumRough.
Field: Thickness
This field characterizes the thickness of the material layer in meters. This should be the dimension of the layer in the direction perpendicular to the main path of heat conduction. This value must be a positive number. Depths of 0.10 m (4 inches) and 0.15 m (6 inches) are common. Default if this field is left blank is 0.1. Maximum is 0.7 m. Must be greater than 0.05 m.
Field: Conductivity of Dry Soil
This field is used to enter the thermal conductivity of the material layer. Units for this parameter are W/(m-K). Thermal conductivity must be greater than zero. Typical soils have values from 0.3 to 0.5. The minimum is 0.2, the default is 0.35, and the maximum is 1.5.
Field: Density of Dry Soil
This field is used to enter the density of the material layer in units of kg/m. Density must be a positive quantity. Typical soils range from 400 to 1000 (dry to wet). Minimum is 300, maximum is 2000 and default if field is left blank is 1100.
Field: Specific Heat of Dry Soil
This field represents the specific heat of the material layer in units of J/(kg-K). Note that these units are most likely different than those reported in textbooks and references which tend to use kJ/(kg-K) or J/(g-K). They were chosen for internal consistency within EnergyPlus. Only positive values of specific heat are allowed.
Field: Thermal Absorptance
The thermal absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident long wavelength (>2.5 microns) radiation that is absorbed by the material. This parameter is used when calculating the long wavelength radiant exchange between various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate). For long wavelength radiant exchange, thermal emissivity and thermal emittance are equal to thermal absorptance. Values for this field must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (with 1.0 representing “black body” conditions). Typical values are from 0.9 to 0.98. The default value for this field is 0.9.
Field: Solar Absorptance
The solar absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident  solar radiation that is absorbed by the material. Solar radiation (0.3 to 2.537) includes the visible spectrum as well as infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. This parameter is used when calculating the amount of incident solar radiation absorbed by various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate). If solar reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials). Values for this field must be between 0.0 and 1.0. Typical values are from .6 to .85. The default value for this field is 0.7.
Field: Visible Absorptance
The visible absorptance field in theMaterialinput syntax represents the fraction of incident visible wavelength radiation that is absorbed by the material. Visible wavelength radiation ( 0.37 to 0.78weighted by photopic response) is slightly different than solar radiation in that the visible band of wavelengths is much more narrow while solar radiation includes the visible spectrum as well as infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. This parameter is used when calculating the amount of incident visible radiation absorbed by various surfaces and affects the surface heat balances (both inside and outside as appropriate) as well as the daylighting calculations. If visible reflectance (or reflectivity) data is available, then absorptance is equal to 1.0 minus reflectance (for opaque materials). Values for this field must be between 0.5 and 1.0. The default value for this field is 0.75.
Field: Saturation Volumetric Moisture Content of the Soil Layer
The field allows for user input of the saturation moisture content of the soil layer. Maximum moisture content is typically less than .5. Range is [.1,.5] with the default being .3.
Field: Residual Volumetric Moisture Content of the Soil Layer
The field allows for user input of the residual moisture content of the soil layer. Default is 0.01, range is [0.01, 0.1].
Field: Initial Volumetric Moisture Content of the Soil Layer
The field allows for user input of the initial moisture content of the soil layer. Range is (0.05, 0.5] with the default being 0.1.
Field: Moisture Diffusion Calculation Method
The field allows for two models to be selected:SimpleorAdvanced. EnergyPlus Currently supports only theSimpleMoisture Diffusion Calculation Method.
Simpleis the original Ecoroof model - based on a constant diffusion of moisture through the soil.  This model starts with the soil in two layers.  Every time the soil properties update is called, it will look at the two soils moisture layers and asses which layer has more moisture in it. It then takes moisture from the higher moisture layer and redistributes it to the lower moisture layer at a constant rate.
Advancedis the later Ecoroof model. The model requires higher number of timesteps in hour for the simulation with a recommended value of 20. This moisture transport model is based on a project which looked at the way moisture transports through soil.  It uses a finite difference method to divide the soil into layers (nodes). It redistributes the soil moisture according the model described in:
Marcel G Schaap and Martinus Th. van Genuchten, 2006, ‘A modified Maulem-van Genuchten Formulation for Improved Description of the Hydraulic Conductivity Near Saturation', VadoseZoneJournal 5 (1), p 27-34. However, currentlyAdvancedMoisture Diffusion Calculation Methodis not supported in EnergyPlus.

MaterialProperty:GlazingSpectralData
With theMaterialProperty:GlazingSpectralDataobject, you can specify the wavelength-by-wavelength transmittance and reflectance properties of a glass material. To determine the  overall optical properties of a glazing system (solar and visible transmittance and solar absorptance vs. angle of incidence) EnergyPlus first calculates transmittance and absorptance vs. angle of incidence for each wavelength. This is then weighted by a standard solar spectrum to get the solar transmittance and absorptance vs. angle of incidence (for use in the solar heat gain calculations), and further weighted by the response of the human eye to get the visible transmittance vs. angle of incidence (for use in the daylighting calculation).
MaterialProperty:GlazingSpectralDatashould be used for multi-pane windows when one or more of the glass layers isspectrally selective, i.e., the transmittance depends strongly on wavelength. An example is glass with a coating that gives high transmittance in the daylight part of the solar spectrum (roughly 0.4 to 0.7 microns) and low transmittance at longer wavelengths, thus providing better solar heat gain control than uncoated glass. If spectral data is not used in case, the overall optical properties of the glazing system that EnergyPlus calculates will not be correct.
You can input up to 450 sets of values for wavelengths covering the solar spectrum. Each set consists of  {wavelength (microns), transmittance, front reflectance, back reflectance}
Spectral data of this kind are routinely measured by glass manufacturers. Data sets for over 800 commercially available products are contained in an Optical Data Library maintained by the Windows Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This library can be downloaded fromhttp://windows.lbl.gov/. You will have to edit entries from this library to put them in the format required by the EnergyPlus WindowGlassSpectralData object.
An alternative to using theMaterialProperty:GlazingSpectralDataobject is to run theWINDOWwindow analysis program. This program has built-in access to the Optical Data Library and let's you easily create customized, multi-layer glazing systems that can be exported for use in EnergyPlus. For more details, see “StormWindow”.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the spectral data set. It is referenced byWindowMaterial:Glazingwhen Optical Data Type = Spectral.
Fields 1-4 (repeated up to 450 times)
Sets of values for wavelengths covering the solar spectrum (from about 0.25 to 2.5 microns [10m]). Each set consists of
{wavelength (microns), transmittance, front reflectance, back reflectance}
The wavelength values must be in ascending order. The transmittance and reflectance values are at normal incidence. “Front reflectance” is the reflectance for radiation striking the glass from the outside, i.e., from the side opposite the zone in which the window is defined. “Back reflectance” is the reflectance for radiation striking the glass from the inside, i.e., from the zone in which the window is defined. Therefore, for exterior windows, “front” is the side closest to the outdoors and “back” is the side closest to the zone in which the window is defined. For interior windows, “front” is the side closest to the adjacent zone and “back” is the side closest to the zone in which the window is defined.

Construction
For walls, roofs, floors, windows, and doors, constructions are “built” from the included materials. Each layer of the construction is a material name listed in order from “outside” to “inside”. Up to ten layers (eight for windows) may be specified (one of the few limitations in EnergyPlus!). “Outside” is the layer furthest away from theZoneair (not necessarily the outside environment). “Inside” is the layer next to theZoneair. In the example floor below, for example, the outside layer is the acoustic tile below the floor, the next layer is the air space above the tile, and the inside layer is the concrete floor deck.
Example Floor Construction illustration.[fig:example-floor-construction-illustration.]
Windowconstructions are similarly built up from items in theWindowMaterials set using similar layers.. See Figure17. Illustration for material ordering in windows, which shows the case where an interior shading layer such as a blind is present. The gap between the inside glass layer (layer #3) and the interior shading layer is not entered. Similarly, for an exterior shading layer, the gap between the outside glass layer and the shading layer is not entered.
Illustration for material ordering in windows.[fig:illustration-for-material-ordering-in]
However, for a between-glass shading device the gaps on either side of the shading layer must be entered and they must have the same gas type. In addition, the gap widths with and without the between-glass shading layer must be consistent (see Figure18).
A maximum of four glass layers and one shading layer is allowed. A gas layer must always separate adjacent glass layers in a multi-pane glazing without a between-glass shading layer.

Outside and inside air film resistances are never given as part of a construction definitions since they are calculated during the EnergyPlus simulation. Note also that constructions are assumed to be one-dimensional in a direction perpendicular to the surface.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a user specified name that will be used as a reference by other input syntax. For example, a heat transfer surface (ref:BuildingSurfaces) requires a construction name to define what the make-up of the wall is. This name must be identical to one of theConstructiondefinitions in the input data file.
Field: Outside Layer
Each construction must have at least one layer. This field defines the material name associated with the layer on the outside of the construction-outside referring to the side that is not exposed to the zone but rather the opposite side environment, whether this is the outdoor environment or another zone.Materiallayers are defined based on their thermal properties elsewhere in the input file (ref:MaterialandMaterialProperties and Materials for Glass Windows and Doors). As noted above, the outside layer should NOT be a film coefficient since EnergyPlus will calculate outside convection and radiation heat transfer more precisely.
Field(s) 2-10: Layers
The next fields are optional and the number of them showing up in a particularConstructiondefinition depends solely on the number of material layers present in that construction. The data expected is identical to the outside layer field (see previous field description). The order of the remaining layers is important and should be listed in order of occurrence from the one just inside the outside layer until the inside layer is reached. As noted above, the inside layer should NOT be a film coefficient since EnergyPlus will calculate inside convection and radiation heat transfer more precisely.

Constructions - Modeling Underground Walls and Ground Floors Defined with C and F Factors for Building Energy Code Compliance
Buildingenergy code and standards like ASHRAE 90.1, 90.2 and California Title 24 require the underground wall constructions and slabs-on-grade or underground floors not to exceed certain maximum values of C-factor and F-factor, which do not specify detailed layer-by-layer materials for the constructions.
A simplified approach is introduced to create equivalent constructions and model the ground heat transfer through underground walls and ground floors for the building energy code compliance calculations. The approach is to create constructions based on the user defined C or F factor with two layers: one concrete layer (0.15 m thick) with thermal mass, and one fictitious insulation layer with no thermal mass. Three new objects were created for such purpose:Construction:CfactorUndergroundWall,Construction:FfactorGroundFloor, andSite:GroundTemperature:FCfactorMethod. Details of the approach are described in the Engineering Reference document. The wall and floor construction objects are described in this section; the ground temperature object is described with the other ground temperature objects.
When a underground wall or ground floor surface(BuildingSurface:Detailed,Floor:Detailed,andWall:Detailed)references one of the two construction objects, its field ‘Outside Boundary Condition' needs to be set to GroundFCfactorMethod. For simple (rectangular) wall and floor objects, the outside boundary condition is inferred from the construction type.
TheSite:GroundTemperature:FCfactorMethodis described in the section for ground temperatures, the following section describes the two new construction objects.
Construction:CfactorUndergroundWall
This input object differs from the usual wall construction object in that it describes an entire construction rather than individual layers. This object is used when only the wall height (depth to the ground) and the C-factor are available.  This object accesses a model that creates an equivalent layer-by-layer construction for the underground wall to approximate the heat transfer through the wall considering the thermal mass of the earth soil.
This object is referenced by underground wall surfaces with their fields ‘Outside Boundary Condition' set to GroundFCfactorMethod.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the underground wall construction.
Field: C-Factor
C-Factor is the time rate of steady-state heat flow through unit area of the construction, induced by a unit temperature difference between the body surfaces. The C-Factor unit is W/m·K. The C-factor does not include soil or air films. ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and California Title 24 specify maximum C-factors for underground walls depending on space types and climate zones.
Field: Height
This field describes the height of the underground wall, i.e. the depth to the ground surface. The unit is meters.

Construction:FfactorGroundFloor
This input object differs from the usual ground floor construction object in that it describes an entire construction rather than individual layers. This object is used when only the floor area, exposed perimeter, and the F-factor are available.  This object accesses a model that creates an equivalent layer-by-layer construction for the slab-on-grade or underground floor to approximate the heat transfer through the floor considering the thermal mass of the earth soil.
This object is referenced by slab-on-grade or underground floor surfaces with their fields ‘Outside Boundary Condition' set to GroundFCfactorMethod.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the ground floor construction.
Field: F-Factor
F-Factor represents the heat transfer through the floor, induced by a unit temperature difference between the outside and inside air temperature, on the per linear length of the exposed perimeter of the floor. The unit for this input is W/m·K. ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and California Title 24 specify maximum F-factors for slab-on-grade or underground floors depending on space types and climate zones.
Field: Area
This field describes the area (in square meters) of the slab-on-grade or underground floor.

ConstructionProperty:InternalHeatSource
In some cases, such as radiant systems, a construction will actually have resistance wires or hydronic tubing embedded within the construction. Heat is then either added or removed from this building element to provide heating or cooling to the zone in question. In the case of building-integrated photovoltaics, the energy removed in the form of electricity will form a sink. It is possible to enter such constructions into EnergyPlus with the syntax described below. The internal source capability is available with both theConductionTransferFunctionandConductionFiniteDifferencesolution algorithms. The only difference is that the two dimensional pipe arrangements are not available to ConductionFiniteDifference. Those fields are ignored in that implementation.
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a user specified name that will be used as a reference by other input syntax. For example, a heat transfer surface (ref:BuildingSurfaces) requires a construction name to define what the make-up of the wall is.
Field: Source Present After Layer Number
This field is an integer that relates the location of the heat source or sink. The integer refers to the list of material layers that follow later in the syntax and determines the layer after which the source is present. If a source is embedded within a single homogenous layer (such as concrete), that layer should be split into two layers and the source added between them. For example, a value of “2” in this field tells EnergyPlus that the source is located between the second and third material layers listed later in the construction description (see layer fields below). This field must be between 1 and the number of material layers in the construction (maximum of 10 layers).
Field: Temperature Calculation Requested After Layer Number
The nature of this field is similar to the source interface parameter (see previous field) in that it is an integer, refers to the list of material layers that follow, and defines a location after the layer number identified by the user-defined number. In this case, the user is specifying the location for a separate temperature calculation rather than the location of the heat source/sink. This feature is intended to allow users to calculate a temperature within the construction. This might be important in a radiant cooling system where condensation could be a problem. This temperature calculation can assist users in making that determination in absence of a full heat and mass balance calculation. This field must be between 1 and the number of material layers in the construction (maximum of 10 layers).
It should also be noted that when using this construction in conjunction with a low temperature radiant system such as thevariable flow,constant flow, orelectricradiant system that this parameter also defines the location for the temperature that is used with the Surface Interior Temperature control. In other words, when using the Surface Interior Temperature control with a low temperature radiant system, the location for this temperature that is interior to the radiant surface is also defined in part by this input field. Note that two fields below (Dimensions for the CTF CalculationandTwo-Dimensional Temperature Calculation Position) will also have an impact on this location if the user elects to perform a 2-D solution for the surfaces using this construction.
Field: Dimensions for the CTF Calculation
This field is also an integer and refers to the detail level of the calculation. A value of “1” states that the user is only interested in a one-dimensional calculation. This is appropriate for electric resistance heating and for hydronic heating (when boiler/hot water heater performance is not affected by return and supply water temperatures). A value of “2” will trigger a two-dimensional solution for this surface only. This may be necessary for hydronic radiant cooling situations since chiller performance is affected by the water temperatures provided.
A few things should be noted about requesting two-dimensional solutions. First, the calculation of the conduction transfer functions (CTF) is fairly intensive and will require a significant amount of computing time. Second, the solution regime is two-dimensional internally but it has a one-dimensional boundary condition imposed at the inside and outside surface (i.e., surface temperatures are still isothermal as if the surface was one-dimensional).
Field: Tube Spacing
This field defines the distance between adjacent hydronic tubes spaced in the direction perpendicular to the main direction of heat transfer. The value for this parameter must be greater than or equal to 0.01m (or a tube spacing of 1 cm) and less than or equal to 1.0m (or a tube spacing of 1m). Note that this parameter is only used for two-dimensional solutions (see previous field) or when the user requests that the tube length for a hydronic radiant system (variable floworconstant flow) be autosized. In the case of autosizing the tube length, this parameter is used along with the dimensions of the surface to approximate the tube length.
Field: Two-Dimensional Temperature Calculation Position
This field only has a meaning when the user opts to have a two-dimensional solution inDimensions for the CTF Calculationabove. It is used in conjunction with the information inTemperature Calculation Requested After Layer Numberabove to specify a location for where the simulation will calculate a temperature at the interior of a surface. TheTemperature Calculation Requested After Layer Numberfield sets where the position is in the main direction of heat transfer. This field determines the position of this point in the directionperpendicularto the main direction of heat transfer. Note that this parameter is a dimensionless value that is allowed to range from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 is used for a position that is in line with the tubing in the construction. A value of 1.0 is used for a position that is at the mid-point between adjacent tubes. The user is also given the flexibility to select a point in between those two extremes.
It should also be noted that for values between 0.0 and 1.0 will not allow for exact positioning of the point at which this temperature is calculated. Instead, it will be used to calculate which node in the state space representation will be used to calculate the temperature. Currently, EnergyPlus uses seven nodes in the direction perpendicular to the main direction of heat transfer. In this case, 0.0 represents the first node and 1.0 represents the seventh or last node in the perpendicular direction. So, this field will be used to determine which node in the direction perpendicular to the main direction of heat transfer to use and there are five other nodes (second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth) that are possible locations. For example, if the user enters a value of 0.167, the second node will be used. Likewise, if the user enters a value of 0.1, because this will be closest to the second node, the second node will be used to calculate the internal temperature. For more information on two-dimensional heat transfer within surfaces usingConstructionProperty:InternalHeatSource,please refer to the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference.

Construction:AirBoundary
Construction:AirBoundaryindicates an open boundary between two zones. It may be used for base surfaces and fenestration surfaces. When this construction type is used, the Outside Boundary Condition of the surface (or the base surface of a fenestration surface) must be eitherSurfaceorZone. A base surface withConstruction:AirBoundarycannot hold any fenestration surfaces.
The two zones separated by this air boundary will be grouped together into a combined enclosure for solar distribution, daylighting, and radiant exchange (including distribution of radiant internal gains). If a given zone has an air boundary with more than one zone, then all of the connected zones will be grouped together. For example, if there is an air boundary between zones A and B, and another air boundary between zones B and C, all three zones (A, B, and C) will be grouped into a single enclosure. Normal default simplified view factors will apply unless detailed view factors are specified usingZoneProperty:UserViewFactors:BySurfaceName.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of the construction.
Field: Air Exchange Method
This field controls how the surface is modeled for radiant exchange calculations. There are two choices:
There will be no air exchange modeled across this surface. Other objects, such asZoneMixingandZoneCrossMixingor AirflowNetwork openings may be specified if desired.
For each pair of zones connected byConstruction:AirBoundary,a pair ofZoneMixingobjects will created automatically. These mixing objects may be automatically adjusted to balance HVAC system flows using theZoneAirMassFlowConservationobject.
Field: Simple Mixing Air Changes per Hour
If the Air Exchange Method isSimpleMixing* then this field specifies the air change rate [1/hr] using the volume of the smaller zone as the basis. The default is 0.5. If an AirflowNetwork simulation is active this field is ignored.

Composite Wall Constructions
Standard constructions in EnergyPlus are built with the materials and layers described earlier. However, some configurations will not be adequately represented by using this approach. The Reference Data Set CompositeWallConstructions.idf contains constructions and associated materials for a set ofcompositewalls. These are walls-such as stud walls-that have complicated heat-flow paths so that the conduction is two- or three-dimensional. Thermal bridges are one of the common terms for these complicated heat-flow paths; this dataset will help you represent these in EnergyPlus.
The materials here arenotreal materials but are “equivalent” materials obtained from finite-difference modeling. (The thickness, conductivity, density and specific heat values of the material layers for the different constructions have been taken from the ASHRAE report “Modeling Two- and Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer through Composite Wall andRoofAssemblies in Hourly Energy Simulation Programs (1145-TRP),” by Enermodal Engineering Limited, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Polish Academy of Sciences, January 2001.). EnergyPlus will calculate conduction transfer functions using these materials. The heat transfer based on these conduction transfer functions will then be very close to what would be calculated with a two- or three-dimensional heat transfer calculation.
For stud walls, using these composite constructions will give more accurate heat flow than you would get by manually dividing the wall into a stud section and a non-stud section.
If your wall's exterior or interior roughness or thermal, solar or visible absorptances are different from those in the data set, you can make the appropriate changes to the first material (the outside layer) or the third material (the inside layer).None of the other values should be changed.
Complete description of the CompositeWallConstructions data set are found in the OutputDetailsAndExamples document.
Construction:ComplexFenestrationState
This input object is used to describe the properties of a single state for complex fenestration.  There are two parts to the input, 1) layer-by-layer physical description of fenestration system and 2) a set of matrices that describe overall system optical performance.  Each layer also has associated with it two matrices that give the layer absorptance (for front and back incidence on the system).
The optical properties are given as a two-dimensional matrix describing the basis and four two-dimensional matrices of system bidirectional optical properties.
These input objects will generally be exported directly from theWINDOWprogram and it is expected that users usually will not develop the input themselves. However, this is an option for users who prefer to use a different method (e.g., Monte-Carlo ray-trace or measurement) of determining optical properties.
Multiple instances of this object are used to define the separate operating states of complex fenestration.  For example, blinds could be deployed or redirected to create a new state, or electrochromic glazings could change transmittance.  Each separate state defines the materials present and the overall optical performance.  If the glazing system has only one state, then only one of these objects is needed.
If there is more than one complex fenestration state, it will be controlled using the EMS actuator called “Surface” with the control type“ConstructionState" and the EMS input object calledEnergyManagementSystem:ConstructionIndexVariable.
Note that when using the Solar Distribution method ofFullInteriorAndExteriororFullInteriorAndExteriorWithReflections, theConstruction:ComplexFenestrationStatewindows are not suggested to be mix-used together with regular windows (windows constructed from “actual” materials descriptions, or simple layers) in the same zone, due to the limitations of the current models. When these two solar distribution methods are used, it is suggested using either all regular windows or all Complex Fenestration windows in the same zone, but not a mix of these two types of windows.

Construction:WindowEquivalentLayer
This object defines the construction for equivalent layer window (ASHWAT) model. This window can model various mix of glazing and shading layers combination. Shadings are defined as an integral part of the construction. The construction is defined by listing the layers name starting with outside layer and work your way to the inside Layer. Up to six solid layers (glazing and shade) and up to five gaps, i.e., a total of up to 11 layers maximum are allowed in equivalent layer window object. The solid layer types allowed are: Glazing, Insect Screen, Roller Blinds, Venetian Blind, and Drape Fabrics. This window model requires optical data of the individual glazing and shading layers to calculate the effective optical properties of the composite fenestration construction. Venetian blinds in equivalent layer window model can be in a fixed slat angle or has the option to control the slat angle in order to maximize visibility, or maximize solar gains. An equivalent-layer concept can simulate wide range of multiple glazing and shading layers combination and provides unlimited flexibility to combine different types of shading layers in a fenestration. The equivalent-layer window model does not support daylighting control. For the gap layer object any one of the five different Gas types can be specified: AIR, ARGON, XENON, KRYPTON, or CUSTOM. This window object is referenced by fenestration surfaces. For details of the model description refer to Equivalent Layer Fenestration Model section in Engineering Reference. The various layer objects that can be referenced in Equivalent Layer window model are:
WindowMaterial:Glass:EquivalentLayer
WindowMaterial:Shade:EquivalentLayer
WindowMaterial:Drape:EquivalentLayer
WindowMaterial:Blind:EquivalentLayer
WindowMaterial:Screen:EquivalentLayer
WindowMaterial:Gap:EquivalentLayer
Inputs
Field: Name
This field is a user specified name that will be used as a reference by other input syntax. For example, a heat transfer surface (ref: Fenestration) requires a construction name to define what the make-up of the fenestration is. This name must be identical to one of theWindowConstructionEquivalent Layer definitions in the input data file.
Field: Outside Layer
Each equivalent layer window construction must have at least one layer. This field defines the material name associated with the layer on the outside of the construction-outside referring to the side that is exposed to the outdoor environment or another zone.Materiallayers for equivalent layer window model are defined based on their thermal properties elsewhere in the input file (ref: WindowEquivalentLayerMaterialNames)
Field: Layer 2 - Layer11
The next fields are optional and the number of them showing up in a particular equivalent layer window construction definition depends solely on the number of material layers present in that construction. The data expected is identical to the outside layer field (see previous field description). The order of the remaining layers is important and should be listed in order of occurrence from the one just inside the outside layer until the inside layer is reached. As noted above, the inside layer should NOT be a film coefficient since EnergyPlus will calculate inside convection and radiation heat transfer more precisely.
An IDF example for this object, is shown below:

Construction:WindowDataFile
TheWINDOWprogram, which does a thermal and optical analysis of a window under different design conditions, writes a data file(“Windowdata file“) containing a description of the window that was analyzed. TheConstruction:WindowDataFileobject allows a window to be read in from theWINDOWdata file-see”Importing Windows fromWINDOW.“For information on adding a shading device to the window see“WindowShadingControl.”
Inputs
Field: Name
This is the name of a window on theWindowdata file. An error will result if EnergyPlus cannot find a window of this name on the file, or if the file, shown in the next field, is not present. The location of the data file should be specified in the File Name field. For details on what is done with the data if a matching window is found on the file see “Importing Windows fromWINDOW.“
Field: File Name
This is the file name of theWindowdata file that contains theWindowreferenced in the previous field. The field may include a full path with file name, for precise results. The field must be <= 100 characters. The file name must not include commas or an exclamation point. A relative path or a simple file name should work with version 7.0 or later when using EP-Launch even though EP-Launch uses temporary directories as part of the execution of EnergyPlus. If using RunEPlus.bat to run EnergyPlus from the command line, a relative path or a simple file name may work if RunEPlus.bat is run from the folder that contains EnergyPlus.exe.
If this field is left blank, the file name is defaulted to Window5DataFile.dat.
