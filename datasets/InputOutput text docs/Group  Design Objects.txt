Input for Design Calculations and Component Autosizing
Overview
In order for EnergyPlus to successfully calculate zone design sensible/latent heating and cooling loads and air flow rates and for the program to use these results to automatically size the HVAC components a number of input objects must be present and certain object input fields must be entered.
The input file should contain aSimulationControlobject. The 1fieldDoZoneSizing Calculationshould be entered asYes. This will cause a zone sizing simulation to be done using all the sizing periods in the input file as weather. If there are no air or water loops in the HVAC input fields 2 and 3 can be set toNo.If there are one or more air loops (i.e., there is at least oneAirLoopHVACobject in the input file) then the 2fieldDo System Sizing Calculationshould be entered asYes. If there are one or more water loops (Plant Loop objects) then the 3fieldDo Plant Sizing Calculationshould be set toYes. Finally either the 4field (Run Simulation for Sizing Periods) or the 5field (Run Simulation for Weather File Run Periods) should be set toYesin order to autosize the components and do a real simulation using the autosized components. The component autosizing calculations are done on the first pass through the HVAC system in the real simulation.There must be at least 2 (up to any number) SizingPeriod objects present. Normally one will be for summer conditions and one for winter. The summer day should normally have the fieldDay Typeset toSummerDesignDay. The winter design day should normally haveDay Typeset toWinterDesignDay.To apply a global sizing factor include theSizing:Parametersobject.For each controlled zone in the input file there should be a correspondingSizing:Zoneobject. Similarly for eachAirLoopHVACthere should be aSizing:Systemobject. And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be aSizing:Plantobject. Note however that if a controlled zone has no correspondingZoneSizing object the data from the firstZoneSizing object will be used. Thus if all the zone sizing information is the same only oneZoneSizing object need be entered.Only controlled zones are included in the zone and system sizing calculations. Thus for a design air flow rate to be calculated for a zone, it must contain a thermostateven though it might not need or have a thermostat in the full simulation. An illustration would be a three zone building with a packaged single zone system and a thermostat in one of the zones. In order for the two slave zones to be included in the design air flow calculations they must be treated as if they have a thermostat: there must be aZoneControl:Thermostatfor each of the slave zones. When sizing latent loads, a humidistat is not required for sizing calculations, however, a humidistat is required to control zone moisture levels.Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9and 10day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has fieldDay Typeset toSummerDesignDaythe day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has fieldDay Typeset toWinterDesignDaythe day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:

And for each Plant or Condenser Loop there should be aSizing:Plantobject.

Some attention should be paid to schedules. In a weekly schedule object the 9and 10day schedules are for summer and winter design days respectively. This means that if a SizingPeriod object has fieldDay Typeset toSummerDesignDaythe day schedule for summer sizing periods will be in effect. Similarly if a SizingPeriod object has fieldDay Typeset toWinterDesignDaythe day schedule for winter sizing periods will be in effect. Some possible applications of this capability are:
1)   setting internal loads (lights, equipment, occupancy) to maximum all day for cooling and to zero all day for heating;
2)   setting heating and cooling thermostat set points to constant values (no set up or set back);
3)   setting heating and cooling equipment to be always on.
None of these applications are necessarily recommended but these and other uses of the special summer/winter design day schedules may prove useful for specific situations.
Other than zone thermostat setpoints, the sizing calculations generally know nothing about the system control inputs such as setpoints and availability schedules. The user must coordinate sizing inputs with the actual simulation control inputs.The sizing calculations only recognize the presence of central heating and cooling coils, preheat and precool coils and reheat coils. These are assumed to deliver the various supply temperatures specified in theSizing:SystemandSizing:Zoneobjects. The impact of other components such as heat recovery, dehumidifiers, and pumps are not accounted for in the sizing calculations. Central supply and return fan temperature rise is taken into account in sizing the central cooling coils.

Component Autosizing
For autosizing to occur at the component level the user must enter the special valueautosizein the numeric fields for which autosizing is available. Those fields can be found by looking at the Energy+.idd data dictionary file or under individual object details in this document. Fields that can be autosized are denoted with the comment\autosizable. The components and fields that are autosizable are listed in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.
There are 3 places in the input where the user can impose sizing factors.
1.    In Sizing Parameters (object:Sizing:Parameters),the user can specify an over-all sizing factor. This factor is applied to all the zone design loads and air flow rates resulting from the zone sizing calculations.
2.    InZoneSizing (object:Sizing:Zone),the user can specify a sizing factor for a specific zone. The factor is applied to the calculated zone design loads and air flow rates for the zone named in theSizing:Zoneobject. This sizing factor overrides the global sizing factor. That is, a zone sizing factor, if specified, replaces the global sizing factor for the named zone.
3.    For some plant components (basically all central chillers, boilers and cooling towers) the user can specify a sizing factor that modifies the autosized component capacity and flow rates. These factors are applied after the application of global or zone sizing factors. They are primarily used to split the design load between multiple components. These sizing factors can change the autosizing of the associated loops and pumps. The following rules are followed the effect of plant component sizing factors on loops and pumps.
a.    For supply side branches, the sizing factors of all components in series on the branch are summed and the result becomes the branch sizing factor. If there is a branch pump its autosized design flow rate is multiplied by the branch sizing factor.
b.   For each loop, if the average of the branch sizing factors is less than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the sum of the branch sizing factors. If the average is greater than 1, the loop sizing factor is set equal to the maximum of the branch sizing factors. The loop sizing factor is applied to the loop design flow rate (if autosized) and to the loop pump flow rate (if autosized).
Mixing User-Specified and Autosized Inputs
Mixed user-specified and autosized inputs can be successfully used if the following points and suggestions are followed.
1.    Each component is autosized independently. Thus user input for a flow rate in one component will have no effect on other components' autosized flow rates. For instance, specifying the chilled water loop pump's rated flow rate will have no effect on the autosizing of the chiller's design evaporator flow rate or on the plant loop's autosized maximum loop flow rate.
2.    Within a component it is best to autosize all inputs and enter specified values for all inputs. For example, in a chiller, if only the nominal capacity is user-specified, the autosized chilled water flow rate may not be consistent with the specified capacity.
3.    Sizing information flows only from the sizing objects to the components. The sizing calculations have no knowledge of user-specified values in a component. The only exception to this rule is that plant loop sizing will collect all component design water flow rates whether autosized or user-specified.
4.    If the user wants to specify a zone or system air flow rate it should be done using theSizing:ZoneandSizing:Systemobjects rather than done in the individual components.
5.    The plant loop flow rates are sized from the total design demand of the components connected to each loop. The components demanding water need not be autosized for the plant loop autosizing to work successfully. So the user could specify all the air side components and autosize all the plant loops and plant components. Or specify the chilled water loop flow rate, chilled water pump inputs and chiller inputs and let the condenser loop and tower autosize.
Component Sizing Output
The results of the component autosizing calculations are reported on theeplusout.eiofile. For each component field that has been autosized the object type, object name, field description with unit, and value are printed out as comma separated data on a line beginning withComponent Sizing. Examples of this are shown in the Output Details and Examples document.
The complete list of objects that have autosized fields is shown in the following table. Note that spaces may be inserted in object names to facilitate readability.
User or External Zone Design Flow Rate Inputs
In EnergyPlus the autosizing calculations start with a calculation of the zone design air flow rates using zone by zone design day simulations. The resulting zone design air flow rates and daily air flow sequences are used in the subsequent HVAC and central plant air and fluid flow design calculations and in the component autosizing calculations. The user can override or change the calculated zone design air flow rates in several ways.
1)    The user can enter a value forSizing Factorin theSizing:Parametersobject (see description below).
2)    The user can specify a zone levelZoneSizing Factorin eachSizing:Zoneobject.
3)    For each zone the user can input aCooling Design Air Flow Rateand/or aHeating Design Air Flow Rate(and specifyCooling Design Air Flow Method = Flow/ZoneandHeating Design Air Flow Method = Flow/Zone). These user inputs override the calculated values. The program divides the user input cooling or heating design air flow rate by the calculated values and uses the result as a zone sizing factor to multiply all the elements in the design heating and cooling air flow and load sequences. From this point the design calculations proceed as usual.
User or External System Design Flow Rate Inputs
Using the results of the zone design air flow rate calculation (including any user input or altered flow rates) EnergyPlus proceeds to calculate central air system flow rates and cooling and heating loads. The results of this calculation can be overridden in the following way.
For each system(AirLoopHVAC),in the correspondingSizing:Systemobject, specifyCooling Design Air Flow Methodto beFlow/Systemand input a value forCooling Design Air Flow Rate. Similarly for heating specifyHeating Design Air Flow Methodto beFlow/Systemand input a value forHeating Design Air Flow Rate.
DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir
This object allows for the outdoor air requirements to be defined in a common location for use by other objects. This object may be referenced by name from other objects (e.g., VAV terminal units,AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat,andAirTerminal:SingleDuct:Mixer)as required to identify an outdoor air quantity for use by that object. Note that a zone name Is not included as an input to this zone outdoor air definition and the number of people in a zone, zone floor area, and zone volume can only be determined after this object has been referenced by another. A single zone outdoor air definition may be referenced by multiple objects to specify that the same outdoor air requirements are used by those objectsormultiple zone outdoor air objects may be defined and referenced by other objects as needed. If multiple zone outdoor air definitions are used, each outdoor air definition must have a unique name.

Appendix A of the ASHRAE 62.1-2010 users manual discusses another method for implementing CO2-based DCV in a single zone system. The last two methods of Proportional Control calculate the required outdoor air flow rate which varies in proportion to the percentage of the CO2 signal range and has two choices to calculate occupancy-based outdoor air rate.ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancyScheduleuses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate.ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancyuses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage.

ProportionalControlBasedOnOccupancyScheduleuses the real occupancy at the current time step to calculate outdoor air rate.
ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOccupancyuses the design occupancy level to calculate outdoor air rate. The former choice is a good approach to estimate outdoor air rate. However, for practical applications, the zone controller usually does not have the real time occupancy information, and the design occupancy level is assumed. The latter choice is used in the design stage.
Field: Outdoor Air Flow per Person
The design outdoor air volume flow rate per person for this zone in cubic meters per second per person, density of air measured at IUPAC standard temperature and pressure. The default is 0.00944 (20 cfm per person). An outdoor air flow rate is calculated based on the total number of people for allPeoplestatements assigned to the zone.

This factor is used along with theZoneVolume and converted to cubic meters per second. This input field is used ifOutdoor Air MethodisAirChanges/Hour, SumorMaximum. The default value for this field is 0.
Field: Outdoor Air Schedule Name
This field is the name of schedule that defines how outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used, then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate defined by the previous fields. The schedule values must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
If thisDesignSpecification:OutdoorAirobject is referenced by aController:MechanicalVentilationobject (either directly or indirectly throughSizing:Zone),the schedule will be applied to all types of outdoor air calculations for the corresponding zone, regardless of the System Outdoor Air Method selected. If the schedule value is zero, then the zone will be completely removed from the system outdoor air calculations.

This field is the name of schedule that defines how minimum outdoor air requirements change over time. The field is optional. If left blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0. If used when the field System Outdoor Air Method = ProportionalControlBasedOnDesignOARate inController:MechanicalVentilation,then the schedule values are multiplied by the outdoor air flow rate.

DesignSpecification:ZoneAirDistribution
This object is used to describe the air distribution effectiveness and fraction of secondary recirculation air (return air not directly mixed with outdoor air) of a zone. It is referenced by theSizing:ZoneandController:MechanicalVentilationobjects.
Inputs
Field: Name
The unique user assigned name for an instance of this object. Any other object referencing this object will use this name.
Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Cooling Mode
The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in cooling mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values.
Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness in Heating Mode
The positive numeric input for this field is the zone air distribution effectiveness when the zone is in heating mode. Default value of this field is 1.0. ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 provides typical values as follows:
Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness (Source: ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010)[fig:zone-air-distribution-effectiveness-source]
Field: Zone Air Distribution Effectiveness Schedule Name
This optional field input points to a schedule with values of zone air distribution effectiveness. It provides a more flexible way of specifying zone air distribution effectiveness if it changes with time and/or system operating status and controls. If the schedule is specified, the zone air distribution effectiveness in cooling mode and heating mode will be ignored.
Field: Zone Secondary Recirculation Fraction
The non-negative numeric input for this field is the fraction of a zone's recirculation air that does not directly mix with the outdoor air. The zone secondary recirculation fraction Er is determined by the designer based on system configuration. For plenum return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with plenum return) Er is usually less than 1.0, although values may range from 0.1 to 1.2 depending upon the location of the ventilation zone relative to other zones and the air handler. For ducted return systems with secondary recirculation (e.g., fan-powered VAV with ducted return), Er is typically 0.0, while for those with system-level recirculation (e.g, dual-fan dual-duct systems with ducted return) Er is typically 1.0. For other system types, Er is typically 0.75. Minimum is 0.0, and default is 0.0 for single-path systems (also to maintain backward compatibility). For parallel fan-powered VAV systems, the secondary ventilation path only functions (Er > 0.0) when the fans in the VAV boxes operate, which is during heating. The local ventilation path and the benefits of secondary recirculation disappear during cooling, when the local parallel fans are off (Er = 0.0).
Field: Minimum Zone Ventilation Efficiency
This optional input sets a minimum on the ventilation efficiency for the zone. It is only used with the Ventilation Rate Procedure (VRP), single-path method. VRP should be chosen in Sizing System, System Outdoor Air Method = Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure. Single-path method is indicated by leaving the previous input(ZoneSecondary Recirculation Fraction) blank or setting it to 0.0. If the calculated value of ventilation efficiency for a zone is less than this value, it is raised to this minimum by raising the zone minimum air flow rate. This new value for zone minimum air flow rate then overrides other defaults and inputs inSizing:Zone.
An example of this in an IDF context is shown:

Sizing:Parameters
This object allows the user to specify global heating and cooling sizing ratios. These ratios will be applied at the zone level to all of the zone heating and cooling loads and air flow rates. These new loads and air flow rates are then used to calculate the system level flow rates and capacities and are used in all component sizing calculations.
The user can also specify the width (in load timesteps) of a moving average window which can be used to smooth the calculated zone design flow sequences. The use of this parameter is described below.
Inputs
Field: Heating Sizing Factor
The global heating sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design heating loads and air flow rates.
Field: Cooling Sizing Factor
The global cooling sizing ratio applied to all of the zone design cooling loads and air flow rates
Field: Timesteps in Averaging Window
The number of load timesteps in the zone design flow sequence averaging window. The default is 1, in which case the calculated zone design flow rates are averaged over the load timestep.
The zone design air flow rate calculation is performed assuming a potentially infinite supply of heating or cooling air at a fixed temperature. Thus the calculated design air flow rate will always be able to meet any load or change in load no matter how large or abrupt. In reality air flow rates are limited by duct sizes and fan capacities. The idealized zone design flow calculation may result in unrealistically large flow rates, especially if the user is performing the sizing calculations using thermostat schedules with night setup or setback. The calculated zone design flow rates are always averaged over the load timestep. The user may want to perform a broader average to mitigate the effect of thermostat setup and setback and prevent the warm up or cool down flow rates from dominating the design flow rate calculation. Specifying the width of the averaging window allows the user to do this.
For example, if the load calculation timestep is 15 minutes and the user specifies theTimesteps in AveragingWindowto be 4, the zone design air flows will be averaged over a time period of 1 hour. Specifying 8 would result in averaging over a 2 hour period.

Inputs
Field: Column Separator
For this field, the desired separator for columns is entered. “Comma” creates comma separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.csv files are created). “Tab” creates tab separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.tab files are created). “Fixed” creates space separated fields/columns in the outputs (eplus<sizing type>.txt files are created) but these are not necessarily lined up for easy printing.
Note that both tab and comma separated files easily import into ExcelTMor other spreadsheet programs. The tab delimited files can also be viewed by text editors, word processing programs and easily converted to “tables” within those programs.
Sizing:Zone
TheSizing:Zoneobject provides the data needed to perform a zone design air flow calculation for a single zone. This calculation assumes a variable amount of supply air at a fixed temperature and humidity. The information needed consists of the zone inlet supply air conditions: temperature and humidity ratio for heating and cooling. The calculation is done for every design day included in the input. The maximum cooling load and air flow and the maximum heating load and air flow are then saved for the system level design calculations and for the component automatic sizing calculations.
TheSizing:Zoneobject is also the place where the user can specify the design outdoor air flow rate by referencing the name of a design specification outdoor air object. This can be specified in a number of ways (ref. DesignSpecification:OutdoorAir).This data is saved for use in the system sizing calculation or for sizing zone components that use outdoor air.
The user can also place limits on the heating and design cooling air flow rates. SeeHeating Design Air Flow MethodandCooling Design Air Flow Methodbelow and the explanations of the various heating and cooling flow input fields.
The user can ask the zone design calculation to take into account the effect of a Dedicated Outdoor Air System on the zone design loads and airflow rates. The design calculation will calculate the heat addition rate to the zone of an idealized SOA system and add or subtract the result from the total zone loads and flow rates.
Latent zone loads can also be calulated when specifying aZoneLoad Sizing Method other than Sensible Load Only No Latent Load. The design latent cooling and heating air flow will be calculated using the specified supply air humidity ratio and saved for further processing. Depending on the user choice forZoneLoad Sizing Method, the sensible, latent or largest load will determine the air flow rate used for the simulation. Care should be used to select appropriate values forZoneCooling Design Supply Air Temperature,ZoneHeating Design Supply Air Temperature,ZoneDehumidification Design Supply Air Humidity RatioandZoneHumidification Design Supply Air Humidity Ratioas these values determine the zone sensible and latent mass flow rates. The larger the temperature difference, the smaller the air flow. Similarly, the larger the humidity ratio difference, the smaller the air flow. Coordinating these inputs will provide accurate results for air mass flow rate and which loads (i.e., sensible or latent) are largest.

The sizing methods input fields available in this objects are for supply air flow and capacity for heating and cooling operating modes. Some zone HVAC equipment has single supply air flow rate input field that serves both cooling and heating operating modes.  So entering either of the cooling or heating scalable sizing input field is sufficient.  When there are separate input fields for cooling, heating, no-cooling, and no-heating operating modes, the corresponding input fields are specified.  The child components supply air flow rate are also sized using scalable sizing methods specified in the parent objects. The methods allow users to enter a fixed or hard sized values, autosizable, or scalable sizing methods.  Methods allowed for sizing supply air flow rates include:SupplyAirFlowRate,FractionOfAutosizedCoolingAirflow,FractionOfAutosizedHeatingAirflow,FlowPerFloorArea, FlowPerCoolingCapacity, andFlowPerHeatingCapacity.  The different sizing options are defined as follows:

FlowPerHeatingCapacity: entered when it is intended that the simulation engine determines the supply air flow rates from the user specifiedsupply air flow per heating capacity valueandautosized heating design capacity.
The  Design Specification ZoneHVAC Sizing object also has input fields for sizing or scalable sizing of cooling and heating capacity. However, most of the parent zone HVAC objects do not have input fields for sizing capacities. So, the capacity scalable sizing fields in the parent objects are used for sizing child components capacity sizings.  The scalable capacity sizing may be indirectly impacted by the scalable supply air flow rates sizing values. Moreover, the autosized cold water, hot water and steam flow rates in the parent zone HVAC objects (e.g. FanCoils, UnitHeaters, UnitVentilators, and VentilatedSlabs) and capacity in child components are determined using the scalable sizing methods. Sizing methods allowed for cooling and heating capacity include:CoolingDesignCapacity, HeatingDesignCapacity,CapacityPerFloorArea, FractionOfAutosizedCoolingCapacity,FractionOfAutosizedHeatingCapacity.

Sizing:System
TheSizing:Systemobject contains the input needed to perform a central forced air system design air flow, heating capacity, and cooling capacity calculation for a system serving one or more zones. The information needed consists of the outside environmental conditions and the design supply air temperatures, outdoor air flow rate, and minimum system air flow ratio.
The outside conditions come from the design days in the input. A system sizing calculation is performed for every design day in the input file and the resulting maximum heating and cooling air flow rates and capacities are saved for use in the component sizing calculations.
Supply air conditions are specified by inputting a supply air temperature for cooling, a supply air temperature for heating, and a preheat temperature.
The system sizing calculation sums the zone design air flow rates to obtain a system supply air flow rate. The design conditions and the outdoor air flow rate are used to calculate a design mixed air temperature. The temperature plus the design supply air temperatures allows the calculation of system design heating and cooling capacities.
Inputs
Field: AirLoop Name
The name of theAirLoopHVACcorresponding to thisSizing:Systemobject. This is the air system for which the design calculation will be made using the input data of thisSizing:SystemObject.
Field: Type of Load to Size On
The user specified type of load on which to size the central system. The choices areSensible,Latent,TotalandVentilationRequirement.Sensible,LatentandTotalmean that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by combining the zone design air flow rates, which have been calculated to meet the zone sensible and latent loads from the design days. Latent sizing requires the the zones connected to this air system be sized for latent loads, otherwise sizing will use sensible loads. Additionally, if zone latent sizing is performed and zone latent loads do not exceed zone sensible loads, sizing will use sensible loads. If any zone latent load exceeds a zone's sensible load, latent sizing will be performed.VentilationRequirementmeans that the central system supply air flow rate will be determined by the system ventilation requirement. In additionSensibletells the program to size the central cooling coil using entering air flow rate and air conditions at the sensible load peak;Totalindicates that the program should size the central cooling coil at the air flow rate and conditions at the total load peak. The central heating coil is always sized at the conditions at the peak sensible heating load.
Field: Design Outdoor Air Flow Rate
The design outdoor air flow rate in cubic meters per second. Generally this should be the minimum outdoor air flow. It is used for both heating and cooling design calculations. The assumption for cooling is that any outdoor air economizer will be closed. IfAutosizeis input the outdoor air flow rate will be taken from the sum of the zone outdoor air flow rates or calculated based on the System Outdoor Air Method selection (field below).
Field: Central Heating Maximum System Air Flow Ratio
The ratio of the maximum system air flow rate for heating to the maximum system air flow rate. The value must be between 0 and 1. For constant volume systems the ratio should be set to 1. This ratio should be set to reflect what the user expects the system flow rate to be when maximum heating demand occurs. This ratio is used in calculating the central system heating capacity. Thus if the system is VAV with the zone VAV dampers held at minimum flow when there is a zone heating demand, this ratio should be set to the minimum flow ratio. If the zone VAV dampers are reverse action and can open to full flow to meet heating demand, this ratio should be set to 1. The default is set to 0.5, reflecting the fact that VAV dampers are typically not allowed to fully open during heating.
This field can be set toAutoSize. When automatically calculated, the ratio is determined from the system heating design flow rate divided by the main (which is usually the max of heating and cooling design flow rates) design flow rate. The design flow rates are also adjusted to be more accurate by examining each of the air terminals attached to the air system and summing the heating and maximum flow rates.

Field: System Outdoor Air Method
The method used to calculate the system minimum outdoor air flow. The three choices are ZoneSum, Standard62.1VentilationRateProcedure (VRP), and Standard62.1SimplifiedProcedure (SP). ZoneSum sums the outdoor air flows across all zones served by the system. VRP uses the multi-zone equations defined in ASHRAE Standard 62.1 to calculate the system outdoor air flow. VRP considers zone air distribution effectiveness and zone diversification of outdoor air fractions. VRP may also adjust autosized air terminal maximum and minimum supply flow rates if needed to ensure adequate outdoor air flow rate to each zone. SP is similar to VRP and was introduced in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2019. The main difference with VRP is that it uses a simplified approach to calculate a system's ventilation efficiency which is in turn used to calculate the system outdoor air flow. Additionally, when set to autosize, the minimum (primary) air flow (or air flow fraction) of these types of air terminals will be calculated following SP:AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:NoReheat(Constant Minimum Air Flow FractionorFixed Minimum Air Flow Fraction),AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat(Constant Minimum Air Flow FractionorFixed Minimum Air Flow Fraction),AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SeriesPIU:Reheat(Minimum Primary Air Flow Fraction),AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ParallelPIU:Reheat(Minimum Primary Air Flow Fraction).

Specifies how the central cooling coil will be controlled, which affects the coil sizing calculation. There are 4 choices: VAV, Bypass, VT, and OnOff. Choose VAV if the cooling output is controlled by varying the air flow. Bypass should be chosen if the capacity is controlled by bypassing a variable fraction of the mixed air around the coil face. VT indicates that cooling coil output is controlled by varying the coil exit temperature while the flow rate is constant. And OnOff means that the cooling output is controlled by cycling the air flow.

Sizing:Plant
TheSizing:Plantobject contains the input needed for the program to calculate plant loop flow rates and equipment capacities when autosizing. This information is initially used by components that use water for heating or cooling such as hot or chilled water coils to calculate their maximum water flow rates. These flow rates are then summed for use in calculating the Plant Loop flow rates.
The program will size any number of chilled water, hot water, condenser water and other plant loops. There should be oneSizing:Plantobject for each plant loop that is to be autosized.
Inputs
Field: Plant or Condenser Loop Name
The name of a Plant Loop or Condenser Loop object corresponding to thisSizing:Plantobject. This is the plant loop for which this data will be used for calculating the loop flow rate.
Field: Loop Type
The possible inputs areHeating, Steam, Cooling,orCondenser.
Field: Design Loop Exit Temperature
The water temperature in degrees Celsius at the exit of the supply side of the plant loop, Thus this is the temperature of the water supplied to the inlet of chilled or hot water coils and other equipment that places loads on a plant loop.
Field: Loop Design Temperature Difference
The design temperature rise (for cooling or condenser loops) or fall (for heating loops) in degrees Celsius across the demand side of a plant loop.  This temperature difference is used by component models to determine flow rates required to meet design capacities.  Larger values lead to smaller design flow rates.
Field: Sizing Option
This field is optional. This field controls how concurrence issues impact the plant loop design flow rate. If it is not used then the program uses noncoincident method, which is the historical behavior prior to version 8.3. There are two choices, noncoincident and coincident. The use of Coincident sizing option requires that theSimulationControlobject be set to YES for the input field called Do HVAC Sizing Simulation for Sizing Periods.
Field: Zone Timesteps in Averaging Window
This field is optional and is only used if the preceding field is set to Coincident. This is the number of zone timesteps used in a moving average to determine the design flow rate from HVAC Sizing Simulation approach. This allows using a broader average over time when using coincident plant sizing. This is similar in concept to the similar field inSizing:Parameterswhich specifies the averaging window for zone loads. The default is 1.
Field: Coincident Sizing Factor Mode
This field is only used if the sizing option is set to Coincident. This field controls the behavior of coincident sizing with respect to what, if any, sizing factor should be applied to further modify the flow rate measured while running HVAC Sizing Simulations. There are four options. Enter the keword None to use the raw value for flow rate without modification. Enter the keyword GlobalHeatingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object calledSizing:Parametersfor heating. Enter the keyword GlobalCoolingSizingFactor to modify the flow by the sizing factor entered in the object calledSizing:Parametersfor cooling. Enter the keyword LoopComponentSizingFactor to modify the flow by a sizing factor determined from the combination of component-level sizing factors in the associated plant loop.

Outputs
The loop flow rates are reported on theeplusout.eiofile along with the component sizing results.
When coincident plant sizing method is used, the eio file contains special summary report with various details and interim values from the calculations, under the following record header: ! , Plant Loop Name, Sizing Pass {#}, Measured Mass Flow{kg/s}, Measured Demand {W}, Demand Calculated Mass Flow{kg/s}, Sizes Changed {Yes/No}, Previous Volume Flow Rate {m3/s}, New Volume Flow Rate {m3/s}, Demand Check Applied {Yes/No}, Sizing Factor {}, Normalized Change {}, Specific Heat{}.
