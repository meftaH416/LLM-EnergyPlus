Group - Airflow Network
Overview
The Airflow Network model provides the ability to simulate multizone airflows driven by wind and also by forced air distribution systems. The model can also simulate the heat and moisture gains or losses from the air distribution system itself (e.g., ductwork). When modeling air distribution systems, the current version of the Airflow Network model is allowed to simulate multiple forced air systems (i.e.,AirLoopHVACobject). Each forced air system allows a constant volume supply air fan(Fan:ConstantVolumeorFan:OnOff),a VAV supply air fan(Fan:VariableVolume),or a fan system model(Fan:SystemMode). The capabilities of the model are to:
Simulate zone pressures due to envelope leakage and forced air distribution during HVAC system fan operationSimulate node pressures in a forced air distribution system during HVAC system fan operationCalculate multizone airflows due to forced air, wind, and surface leakage, including adjacent zones and outdoors, during HVAC system fan operationSimulate distribution system airflows, including supply and return air leaks, during HVAC system fan operationSimulate air distribution system node temperatures and humidity ratios during HVAC system fan operationCalculate duct conduction losses during HVAC system fan operationCalculate vapor diffusion losses of ducts during HVAC system fan operationCalculate sensible and latent loads on the surrounding zones due to supply and return air leaks in the air distribution system during HVAC system fan operationSimulate zone pressures due to envelope leakage driven by wind when the HVAC system fan is off or if no air distribution system is specifiedCalculate multizone airflows due to wind and surface leakage, including adjacent zones and outdoors when the HVAC system fan is off or if no air distribution system is specifiedAllow zone exhaust fans to be included as part of the airflow networkFor airflow networks with a forced air distribution system, calculate zone sensible and latent loads for two different supply air fan operation modes as required: cycling fan, cycling compressor (CyclingFanAndCompressor) and continuous fan, cycling compressor (ContinuousFanWithCyclingCompressor)When multiple forced air systems(AirloopHVAC)are present in the idf, all systems must be used in the Airflow Network model.

TheAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject specifies the ventilation control that applies to all of the openable exterior and interior windows and doors in the corresponding thermal zone. Surface-level ventilation control can be used to override the zone-level ventilation control if required (see AirflowNetwork: MultiZone:Surface object below).

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject represents a connection between two node objects and an AirflowNetwork component. The node objects can be anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Node,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zone.
If you input wind pressure coefficients,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfacealso has an associatedAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNode, that, via theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Wind-PressureCoefficientArrayandAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobjects, gives the wind pressure distribution vs. wind direction for that node and, implicitly, for the cracks and openings in the exterior surfaces associated with that node.
Figure1shows the relationships among AirflowNetwork:MultiZone objects and between AirflowNetwork:MultiZone objects and regular EnergyPlus objects. In this figure an arrow from object A to object B means A references B, i.e., one of the inputs in A is the name of object B. For example, one input for AirflowNetwork: MultiZone:Surface is the name of a heat transfer surface, and another is the name of a crack or opening object. The arrow betweenAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:SurfaceandAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeis shown dashed to indicate that this reference is not used when wind pressure coefficients are calculated by the program rather than being input by the user.
Figure1also shows the relationships among AirflowNetwork:Distribution objects and between AirflowNetwork:Distribution objects and regular EnergyPlus objects. TheAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobjects link two nodes fromAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeand/orAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobjects with a component defined in the object AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component. The solid arrows show a reference from object A to object B. The dashed arrows indicate the components which can be used in a linkage object. The red arrows pointing to theZoneobject indicate the components that interact with the zone air. For example, the temperature in a zone where a supply leak terminates is used to calculate duct leakage energy loss. The temperature in a zone where a duct component is located is also used to calculate duct conduction loss.

Much of the information needed for the air flow calculation is automatically extracted from the building description for thermal modeling. This includes things like the volume and neutral height of the zones, and the orientation and location of the building surfaces that contain cracks or openings through which air flows. From all of this information the program creates a “pressure-flow network” that is solved each timestep using iterative solution methods to obtain the unknown pressures and air flows.
Figure2shows a plan view of a very simple air flow network that you can construct using the above AirflowNetwork objects. There are three thermal zones,Zone-1,Zone-2andZone-3.There are openable exterior windows-Window-1,Window-2and Window-3-and openable interior doors-Door-12 andDoor-23.Two External Nodes are indicated. ExternalNode-1 is associated with the façade that containsWindow-1andWindow-2.ExternalNode-2 is associated with the façade containingWindow-3.
One possible air flow pattern is shown in this figure. The actual air flow pattern in a particular timestep, and the size of the flows, depends on many factors, such as (1) What is the wind pressure distribution seen by the exterior windows? (2) Are the exterior windows open or closed, and if open, how far are they open? (3) Are the interior doors open or closed? (4) What are the air temperature differences between zones and between zones and the outdoor air (which affect buoyancy flows)?
Plan view of a simple air flow network showing a possible air flow pattern in which all of the windows and doors are open.[fig:plan-view-of-a-simple-air-flow-network]
Figure2shows a possible air flow pattern in which all of the windows and doors are open. Associated with the external nodes are wind pressure coefficient distributions as a function of wind direction that are input using two AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Wind Pressure Coefficient objects. The nature of the air flows through the windows and doors is specified usingAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningandAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningobjects. The Airflow Network model calculates the flows each system timestep depending on various factors, including wind direction and speed, size and vertical position of openings, outdoor air temperature, and zone air temperatures.

Cannot Do or Restricted
The model is restricted to using a constant volume or variable volume fan(Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,andFan:VariableVolume).Air circulation and/or air temperature stratification within a thermal zone. For example, you should not try to divide a high space, such as an atrium, into subzones separated by artificial horizontal surfaces that have cracks or openings with the expectation that AirflowNetwork will give you a realistic temperature in each subzone and/or a realistic air flow between subzones.The model is restricted to eleven types of coils that can be in the air distribution system(Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed,Coil:Heating:Fuel,Coil:Heating:Electric,Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed,Coil:Cooling:Water,Coil:Heating:Water,Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry,Coil:Cooling:DX:TwoStageWithHumidityControlMode,Coil:Cooling:DX:MultiSpeed,Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed,andCoil:Heating:Desuperheater).The model is restricted to two types of air distribution equipment terminal units(AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:ReheatandAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat).Supply and return leaks are not allowed in anAirLoopHVAC.They can only be modeled in theZoneEquipment portion of the air loop (i.e., return leaks may be modeled between the zone return node and the zone mixer inlet or the zone mixer outlet and the zone equipment loop outlet; and supply leaks may be modeled between the zone equipment loop inlet and theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitterinlet node or theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitteroutlet node and the zone supply node).An air distribution system must be located inside the building (i.e., the ducts must pass through zones within the building).Zoneexhaust fans must be defined inZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobjects.

The model is restricted to two types of air distribution equipment terminal units(AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:ReheatandAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat).
Supply and return leaks are not allowed in anAirLoopHVAC.They can only be modeled in theZoneEquipment portion of the air loop (i.e., return leaks may be modeled between the zone return node and the zone mixer inlet or the zone mixer outlet and the zone equipment loop outlet; and supply leaks may be modeled between the zone equipment loop inlet and theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitterinlet node or theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitteroutlet node and the zone supply node).
An air distribution system must be located inside the building (i.e., the ducts must pass through zones within the building).
Zoneexhaust fans must be defined inZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobjects.
The input specifications consist of five main sections:AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject, AirflowNetwork multizone data objects, AirflowNetwork distribution node objects, AirflowNetwork distribution component objects,andAirflowNetwork distribution linkage objects.Each of these object types is described in detail below.
AirflowNetwork:SimulationControl
The basic run parameters for this model are defined in this unique object which has the following input specifications:
Inputs
Field: Name
This is a unique character string associated with this instance of theAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject. At this time, only oneAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject can be specified in an input data file (idf).
Field: AirflowNetwork Control
The following selections are available to control the Airflow Network simulation:
MultiZoneWithDistribution:MultiZone air flow calculations are performed during all simulation timesteps, including the impacts of the air distribution system when a HVAC system fan is operating. AnyZoneInfiltration:*,ZoneVentilation:*,ZoneMixingandZoneCrossMixingobjects specified in the input data file are not simulated.
MultiZoneWithoutDistribution: MultiZone air flow calculations are performed during all simulation timesteps, but the air distribution system portion of the network is not modeled even if it is specified in the input data file. AnyZoneInfiltration:*,ZoneVentilation:*,ZoneMixingandZoneCrossMixingobjects specified in the input data file are not simulated.
MultiZoneWithDistributionOnlyDuringFanOperation:MultiZone air flow calculations, including the impacts of the air distribution system, are only performed when the HVAC system fan is operating. AnyZoneInfiltration:*,ZoneVentilation:*,ZoneMixingandZoneCrossMixingobjects specified in the input data file are used when the HVAC system fan is OFF (if none are specified, then no air flow calculations are performed when the fan is OFF).
NoMultiZoneOrDistribution:No multizone air flow calculations (with or without the air distribution system portion of the network) are performed during the simulation. AnyZoneInfiltration:*,ZoneVentilation:*,ZoneMixingandZoneCrossMixingobjects specified in the input data file are simulated (if none are specified, then no air flow calculations are performed). Note: Having an input data file with noAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobjects gives the same impact - no multizone air flow calculations. However, this choice is provided as a convenience to the user to easily disable the multizone air flow calculations for an input data file that already contains AirflowNetwork objects.
Note:AZoneInfiltration:*object indicates any one ofZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate,ZoneInfiltration:EffectiveLeakageArea,andZoneInfiltration:FlowCoefficientobjects.A object ofZoneVentilation:*indicates any one ofZoneVentilation:DesignFlowRateandZoneVentilation:WindandStackOpenAreaobjects.
Field: Wind Pressure Coefficient Type
Determines whether the wind pressure coefficients are input by the user or calculated. The choices areInputorSurfaceAverageCalculation, with the default being SurfaceAverageCalculation.
If INPUT, you must enter anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientArrayobject, one or moreAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects, and one or moreAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobjects.
The second choice, SurfaceAverageCalculation, should only be used forrectangularbuildings. In this case surface-average wind pressure coefficients vs. wind direction are calculated by the program for the four vertical façades and the roof based on user entries for“BuildingType," “Azimuth Angle of Long Axis ofBuilding,“and”Ratio ofBuildingWidth Along Short Axis to Width Along Long Axis" (see description of these fields below). With this choice you donothave to enter any of the following objects: AirflowNetwork:MultiZone: Wind Pressure Coefficient Array,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeandAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValues.
Field: Height Selection for Local Wind Pressure Calculation
Determines whether the local wind pressure is calculated based on either given external node heights or surface opening heights. The choices areExternalNodeorOpeningHeight, with the default being OpeningHeight. The local outdoor wind speed calculation procedure is given in the section of “Local Wind Speed Calculation” in the Engineering Reference. The calculation procedure requires the height input.
IfExternalNode, the heights given in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects are used to calculate local wind pressures based on the given height local wind speed.  Used only if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = INPUT (see description of previous field).
IfOpeningHeight, the number of theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects has to be equal to the number of external surfaces defined in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects. The centroids in the z direction of theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects are the heights used in the local wind pressure calculation with the given height wind speed. The input is required if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = INPUT (see description of previous field).
If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type =SurfaceAverageCalculation, a value in this field is not required and a blank may be entered. The default choice is used internally to generate theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects
Field: Building Type
Used only if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation. The choices forBuildingType are LowRise and HighRise, with the default being LowRise.
LowRise corresponds to a rectangular building whose height is less than three times the width of the footprint (win Figure3) and is less than three times the length of the footprint (win the same figure).
HighRise corresponds to a rectangular building whose height is more than three times the width of the footprint (win Figure3) or is more than three times the length of the footprint (win the same figure).
Field: Maximum Number of Iterations
The maximum number of iterations allowed in finding an AirflowNetwork solution. If the number of iterations at each simulation timestep is above the maximum number of iterations defined by this field, the program could not find the solution and a Severe error is issued and the program is aborted. The default value is 500.
Field: Initialization Type
Designates which method is used for AirflowNetwork initialization. The choices for Initialization Type are LinearInitializationMethod and ZeroNodePressures, with the default being ZeroNodePressures.
Field: Relative Airflow Convergence Tolerance
The solution is assumed to have converged whenis less than the value specified for this input field. This convergence criteria is equivalent to the ratio of the absolute value of the sum of all network airflows () to the sum of network airflow magnitudes (). The default value is 1.0x10.
Field: Absolute Airflow Convergence Tolerance
The solution is assumed to have converged when the summation of the absolute value of all network airflows () is less than the value specified for this input field. The default value is 1.0x10.
Field: Convergence Acceleration Limit
If the ratio of successive pressure corrections is less than this limit, use Steffensen acceleration algorithm (Ref. AirflowNetwork Model in the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference). The range for this field is -1 to 1, with the default value being -0.5.
Field: Azimuth Angle of Long Axis of Building
Gives the orientation of a rectangular building for calculating wind pressure coefficients. This is the smaller of the angles, measured clockwise, between North and the long axis of the building (see Figure3). Used only if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation. The range for this input is 0 to 180, with the default value being 0.
Field: Ratio of Building Width Along Short Axis to Width Along Long Axis
This is the aspect ratio of a rectangular footprint. It is given by the width of the footprint along its short axis divided by the width along the long axis (see Figure3). If the footprint is square, the value of this field is 1.0. Used only if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation. The range for this input is > 0 to 1, with the default value being 1.

The angle a is the “Azimuth Angle of Long Axis of Building.”is the “Ratio of Building Width Along Short Axis to Width Along Long Axis.”[fig:footprint-of-a-rectangular-building-showing]
Field: Height Dependence of External Node Temperature
This is an optional field. Input is Yes or No. The default is No. Yes is that external node temperature is dependent on node height. No means that external node temperature is calculated with zero height.
Field: Allow Unsupported Zone Equipment
This is an optional field. Input is Yes or No. The default is No. Set this input to Yes to have zone equipment that are currently unsupported in the AirflowNetwork model allowed in the simulation. Setting this field to Yes, allows the following equipment to be modeled along an AirflowNetwork model: ZoneHVAC:Dehumidifier,ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator,WaterHeater:HeatPump:*. The AirflowNetwork model will exclude mass balance in these equipment objects and assume the mass flows are self-balanced in the equipment objects.
Field: Do Distribution Duct Sizing Calculation
This is an optional field. Input is Yes or No. The default is No. Yes is to control duct sizing. SeeAirflowNetwork:Distribution:DuctSizingfor sizing options. No means no duct sizing is performed.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zone
This object allows control of natural ventilation through exterior and interior openings in a zone, where “opening” is defined as an openable window or door. (Note that only window, door or glass door subsurfaces in a zone that are specified usingAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpeningorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningand have an associatedAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject are considered to be openings). The control will be applied in the same way to all of the openings in the zone.
This object is required to perform Airflow Network calculations. Note that ventilation control for all openings is provided at the zone level as default and individual ventilation control of a surface opening can be used to override the zone-level control (see theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject description below).
Field: Zone Name
The name of the EnergyPlus thermal zone corresponding to the AirflowNetwork zone.
Field: Ventilation Control Mode
Specifies the type of zone-level natural ventilation control.
Let Tequal the outdoor air temperature, Tequal the previous timestep's zone air temperature, Tequal the Vent Temperature Schedule value, Hequal the specific enthalpy of zone air from the previous timestep, and Hequal the specific enthalpy of outdoor air. Then the four allowed choices for Ventilation Control Mode are:
NoVent: All of the zone's openable windows and doors are closed at all times independent of indoor or outdoor conditions. The Venting Availability Schedule is ignored in this case. This is the default value for this field.
Temperature: All of the zone's openable windows and doors are opened if T> TandT> TandVenting Availability Schedule (see below) allows venting.
Enthalpy:All of the zone's openable windows and doors are opened if H> HandT> TandVenting Availability Schedule allows venting.
Constant: Whenever this object's Venting Availability Schedule allows venting, all of the zone's openable windows and doors are open, independent of indoor or outdoor conditions. Note that “Constant” here means that the size of each opening is fixed while venting; the air flow through each opening can, of course, vary from timestep to timestep.
ASHRAE55Adaptive: All of the zone's operable windows and doors are opened if the operative temperature is greater than the comfort temperature (central line) calculated from the ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 adaptive comfort model and Venting Availability Schedule allows venting.
CEN15251Adaptive:All of the zone's operable windows and doors are opened if the operative temperature is greater than the comfort temperature (central line) calculated from the CEN15251 adaptive comfort model and Venting Availability Schedule allows venting.
Field: Ventilation Control Zone Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name
The name of a schedule of zone air temperature set points that controls the opening of windows and doors in the thermal zone to provide natural ventilation. This setpoint is the temperature above which all the openable windows and doors in the zone will be opened if the conditions described in the previous field Ventilation Control Mode are met.
The Ventilation ControlZoneTemperature Setpoint Schedule Name applies only to windows and doors in the zone that are specified usingAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpeningorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningand have an associatedAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject.
(The discussion under the field Window/Door Opening Factor in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject describes how the actual opening area of a window or door in a particular timestep is determined.)
Modulation of Openings
The following five fields can be used to modulate the window/door openings when Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature or Enthalpy. These fields determine a factor between 0 and 1 that multiplies the opening factor of each window and door in the zone according to the control action shown in Figure5for Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature and in Figure6for Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. Modulation of the openings can reduce the large temperature swings that can occur if the windows/doors are open too far when they are venting, especially when there is a large inside-outside temperature difference.
The modulation takes the following form when Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature:
ifT- T< =   [Lower Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor = 1.0
if[Lower Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor] < T- T< [Upper Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor varies linearly from 1.0 to [Limit Value on Multiplier for Modulating Venting Open Factor]
ifT- T> =   [Upper Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor = [Limit Value on Multiplier for Modulating Venting Open Factor]
One way of “tuning” the following modulation control parameters is to perform a sensitivity analysis for winter and/or summer design days to determine what combination of values causes the biggest reduction in zone air temperature fluctuations due to venting.
Note that the default values for the following fields are such that, if none of the fields are specified, the default values are assigned.
Field: Minimum Venting Open Factor
See Figure5or Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature or Enthalpy. This value may be from zero to 1.0, with the default being 0.0.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Temperature Difference Lower Limit For Maximum Venting Open Factor
See Figure5. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature. This value may be from zero to less than 100 °C, with the default being 0 °C. The value for this field must be less than the value specified for the following field.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Temperature Difference Upper Limit for Minimun Venting Open Factor
See Figure5. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature. This value must be greater than 0 °C, with the default being 100 °C. The value for this field must be greater than the value specified for the previous field..
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Enthalpy Difference Lower Limit For Maximum Venting Open Factor
See Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. This value may be from zero to less than 300,000 J/kg, with the default being 0 J/kg. The value for this field must be less than the value specified for the following field.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Enthalpy Difference Upper Limit for Minimun Venting Open Factor
See Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. This value must be greater than zero, with the default being 300,000 J/kg. The value for this field must be greater than the value specified for the previous field.
Field: Venting Availability Schedule Name
The name of a schedule that specifies when venting is available. A zero or negative schedule value means venting is not allowed. A value greater than zero means venting can occur if other venting control conditions (specified by Ventilation Control Mode and Vent Temperature Schedule Name) are satisfied. This schedule name should not be confused with Vent Temperature Schedule Name.
If a Venting Availability Schedule Name is not specified, it is assumed that venting is always available.
Using Venting Availability Schedule allows you to turn off venting at certain times of the day (at night, for example), of the week (on weekends, for example), or of the year (during the winter, for example).
If used with Ventilation Control Mode = Constant, the ventilation rate is constant only when this schedule allows venting; otherwise the ventilation rate is set to zero.
If Ventilation Control Mode = NoVent, this schedule has no effect.
Field: Single Sided Wind Pressure Coefficient Algorithm
Specifies the type of single sided wind pressure coefficient algorithm to be used for the zone. This field is optional and is only used if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type is set to SurfaceAverageCalculation. The default is Standard and the two valid choices are:
Standard: A single wind pressure coefficient is applied to all openings in the zone, as calculated using SurfaceAverageCalculation.
Advanced: EnergyPlus calculates modified wind pressure coefficients for the two openings in the zone. This model is only valid for zones with two openings, both of which are on a single façade (i.e. are coplanar). For zones with more than two openings, consider combining the openings into two. The modified wind pressure coefficients account for wind direction and turbulence effects on single sided ventilation rates. See the Engineering Reference for a detailed description of the Advanced algorithm. When the Advanced algorithm is selected, the difference between the two modified wind pressure coefficients are output to the .eio file.
Field: Façade Width
This is the whole building width along the direction of the facade of this zone, orin Figure4. This field is used in the Single Sided Wind Pressure Coefficient Algorithm. This field is optional and is only used if the Single Sided Wind Pressure Coefficient Algorithm is set to Advanced. The value must be greater than 0.0 m, with the default being 10 m.
Footprint of a rectangular building showing, the “Façade Width”, used by the Single Sided Wind Pressure Coefficient Algorithm.[fig:single-sided-footprint]
Field: Occupant Ventilation Control Name
The name of an AirlowNetwork:OccupantVentilationControl object. The object is used to perform advanced window opening control based on occupant conditions. When an object name is given, advanced window opening control is performed and, the ventilation control defined in the Ventilation Control Mode field will be overridden.
Note:The Occupant Ventilation Control object can be assigned to a zone(AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zone)or a surface(AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface).When the object is assigned to a zone, the Occupant Ventilation Control is assigned to the surfaces belonging to the zone automatically. The surface objects must have an associatedAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening,orAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningcomponent specified in the field of Leakage Component Name. All output variables will be shown under surface names only, and not under zone names.
Modulation of venting area according to inside-outside temperature difference.[fig:modulation-of-venting-area-according-to]
Modulation of venting area according to inside-outside enthalpy difference.[fig:modulation-of-venting-area-according-to-001]
Note:In order to establish an airflow network, eachAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject must have at least two surfaces defined withAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects, so that air can flow from one zone into other zones (or to outdoors) through the network (air mass flow conserved). In addition, for allAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects facing the sameZone(ref.BuildingSurface:Detailed),at least two different environments must be defined for the other side of these surfaces (e.g., an external node and an adjacent zone, two adjacent zones, or two external nodes).

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface
TheAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject specifies the properties of a surface “linkage” through which air flows. This linkage is always associated with a building surface (wall, roof, floor, or a ceiling) or subsurface (door, glass door, or window) with both faces exposed to air. The linkage specifies two connected nodes: two zone nodes defined inAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobjects based on inside and outside face environment for an interior surface, or a zone node defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject based on inside face environment and an external node defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobject for an exterior surface. The associated leakage component for this surface can be a crack (or surface effective leakage area) in an exterior or interior heat transfer surface or subsurface, or an exterior or interior window, door or glass door (heat transfer subsurface) that can be opened to allow air flow. The allowed surface air leakage components are:
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:CrackAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageAreaAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:SpecifiedFlowRateAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpeningAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFan
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:SpecifiedFlowRate
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFan
The three “opening” components are used to modulate openness based on required conditions.
TheAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject allows a heat transfer surface or subsurface to have one crack (or one surface effective leakage area object), or a subsurface (i.e., window, door or glass door) to have one opening (detailed, simple, or horizontal).
An interior heat transfer surface(BuildingSurface:Detailed)whose surface name is used as the input for the Outside Boundary Condition Object field is adiabatic and is not allowed as anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface.A heat transfer surface defined in the BuildingSurface:Detailed:ExteriorNaturalVentedCavity is also not allowed.
When a non-rectangular subsurface is used, the model will automatically convert it into a rectangular subsurface using equivalent width and height based on an entered choice from the Equivalent Rectangle Method field or a default choice.
When an air boundary surface or subsurface is used(Construction:AirBoundary),all types of leakage component are allowed exceptAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFan.The only allowed venting control type for an air boundary surface is Constant, and the venting schedule is ignored (which means the opening is always fully open at the specified Window/Door Opening Factor, or Crack Factor).EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator“AirFlow Network Window/Door Opening” is available for special applications where control of the air boundary opening is required.
Field: Surface Name
This is the name of the corresponding surface (wall, roof, ceiling, floor, window, door or glass door).
Information on this surface is used by the program as follows:
For a linkage associated with an exterior heat transfer surface: air flow through this linkage is between the outside environment and the thermal zone to which the surface belongs.For a linkage associated with an interior (i.e., interzone) heat transfer surface: air flow through this linkage is between the thermal zones separated by the surface (i.e., the thermal zone associated with the inside face environment and the thermal zone associated with the outside face environment).This heat transfer surface determines the height of the linkage, which is used in calculating buoyancy-related flow through the linkage.The surface may be an air boundary surface or subsurface(Construction:AirBoundary).
For a linkage associated with an exterior heat transfer surface: air flow through this linkage is between the outside environment and the thermal zone to which the surface belongs.
For a linkage associated with an interior (i.e., interzone) heat transfer surface: air flow through this linkage is between the thermal zones separated by the surface (i.e., the thermal zone associated with the inside face environment and the thermal zone associated with the outside face environment).
This heat transfer surface determines the height of the linkage, which is used in calculating buoyancy-related flow through the linkage.
The surface may be an air boundary surface or subsurface(Construction:AirBoundary).
Note:It is possible to define an interzone surface twice in EnergyPlus, once in each of the zones that the surface separates. Previously this was a requirement of EnergyPlus (prior to version 2.0), but now it is optional and the user also has the option of only defining the surface once (EnergyPlus defines the second surface automatically within the program). For each interzone surface, use only one (of possible two) interzone surface names in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject for “Surface Name.”Do notenter twoAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects corresponding to the two possible interzone names. This would cause the air flow through the surface to be counted twice.
Field: Leakage Component Name
The name of theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFanobject associated with this air flow linkage.
If the name of an opening component (i.e. AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening.AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening,orAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningis given here, then the Surface Name in the previous field must be that of a window, door or glass door heat transfer subsurface or a building surface which is an air boundary. Otherwise an error message will be reported.
If the name of anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject orAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageAreaobject is given here, the program will position the crack at the average height of the associated heat transfer surface or subsurface. The user can define multiple heat transfer surfaces (e.g., split a wall into several surfaces) to be more precise in establishing the crack location. Similarly, the user can define multiple heat transfer surfaces if a wall, for example, has multiple cracks or openings that need to be defined individually.
If the name of anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFanis given here, then the Surface Name in the previous field must be that of an exterior heat transfer surface. The zone name defined in theZoneName field for this heat transfer surface must be the same zone name defined in theZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject (which references aZoneHVAC:EquipmentListcontaining the name of the corresponding zone exhaust fan).Otherwise an error message will be reported. When this zone exhaust fan is operating for a simulation timestep, all surface-level controls described below are ignored for that timestep.
Field: External Node Name
The name of the associatedAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobject, which determines the wind pressure coefficients for the heat transfer surface. Used only if Surface Name is for an exterior surface.
If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject, this field is not used and a blank may be entered. If the surface is an interior (i.e., interzone) surface, leave this field blank.
When there is an input object of eitherZoneProperty:LocalEnvironmentorSurfaceProperty:LocalEnvironment,LocalEnvironment is enable, so that entered names ofOutdoorAir:Nodecan be used as inputs for this field. More descrption of use can be found inOutdoorAir:Node.
Field: Window/Door Opening Factor, or Crack Factor
If this linkage is associated with anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpeningobject (which means it is an openable window or door), then this field is called “Window/Door Opening Factor” and represents the value of the Opening Factor that is in effect when the Vent Temperature Schedule (defined in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject) indicates that this window or door is open.
The AirflowNetwork model uses a combination of factors to determine the actual opening area for a window or door when it is venting. For example, consider a window that is 1.5m high and 2.0m wide (excluding frame). Assume that theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningfor this window has Type of Large Vertical Opening = 1 (non-pivoting window), Height Factor = 0.5 and Width Factor = 0.8. Then when the window is fully open, the opening area = height of opening (0.5x1.5) times width of opening (0.8x2.0) = 0.75x1.6 = 1.2 m. If the Window/Door Opening Factor is 0.75, then the opening area = 0.75x1.2 = 0.9 m.
If, in addition, the window is in a thermal zone for which opening modulation has been specified (ref:AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zone)and the multiplication factor due to modulation is 0.3 in a particular timestep, then the actual opening factor that timestep = 0.3x0.75 = 0.225 and the actual opening area that timestep = 0.3x0.9 = 0.27 m.
If this linkage is associated with anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject, the following crack air flow equation is used.

Where
is the air mass flow (kg/s)
is the air mass flow coefficient (kg/s @ 1 Pa)
is the reference condition temperature correction factor (dimensionless). SeeAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject.
is the pressure difference across crack (Pa)
is the air flow exponent (dimensionless)
The following fields control venting. They are used only when Name of Associated Heat Transfer Surface is that of an openable exterior or interior window, door or glass door. They only apply to openings, and do not apply to surface cracks, effective leakage area or zone exhaust fans. If none of these fields is specified, or if Ventilation Control Mode = ZoneLevel, venting is controlled by theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject for the thermal zone containing the window or door (ref:AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ZoneData).
Field: Ventilation Control Mode
Specifies the type of surface-level natural ventilation control.
Letequals the outdoor air temperature,equals the previous timestep's zone air temperature,equals the Vent Temperature Schedule value,equals the specific enthalpy of zone air from the previous timestep, andequals the specific enthalpy of outdoor air. Then the four allowed choices for Ventilation Control Mode are:
NoVent: The openable window or door associated with this surface is closed at all times independent of indoor or outdoor conditions. The Venting Availability Schedule is ignored in this case.
Temperature: The openable window or door associated with this surface is opened ifandandVenting Availability Schedule (see below) allows venting.
Enthalpy:The openable window or door associated with this surface is opened ifandandVenting Availability Schedule allows venting.
Constant: Whenever this object's Venting Availability Schedule allows venting, the openable window or door associated with this surface is open, independent of indoor or outdoor conditions. Note that “Constant” here means that the size of this opening is fixed while venting; the air flow through this opening can, of course, vary from timestep to timestep. If the surface is an air boundary(Construction:AirBoundary)then Constant is the only valid option (other options will throw a warning and be reset to Constant).
ASHRAE55Adaptive: The openable window or door associated with this surface is opened if the operative temperature is greater than the comfort temperature (central line) calculated from the ASHRAE Standard 55-2010 adaptive comfort modelandVenting Availability Schedule allows venting.
CEN15251Adaptive:The openable window or door associated with this surface is opened if the operative temperature is greater than the comfort temperature (central line) calculated from the CEN15251 adaptive comfort modelandVenting Availability Schedule allows venting.
ZoneLevel: Venting of the window or door is not controlled individually, but is controlled instead at the zone level. This means that the venting is determined by theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject for the thermal zone containing the window or door (ref:AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject). This is the default value for this field.
AdjacentTemperature: This choice is used for an interior surface only. The openable interior window or door associated with this surface is opened ifandandVenting Availability Schedule (see below) allows venting, whereis the adjacent zone temperature.
AdjacentEnthalpy:This choice is also used for an interior surface only. The interior openable window or door associated with this surface is opened ifandandVenting Availability Schedule allows venting, whereis the adjacent zone specific enthalpy.
Field: Ventilation Control Zone Temperature Setpoint Schedule Name
The name of a schedule of zone air temperature set points that controls the opening of a window or door associated with this surface to provide natural ventilation. This setpoint is the temperature above which this openable window or door will be opened if the conditions described in the previous field Ventilation Control Mode are met.
The Ventilation ControlZoneTemperature Setpoint Schedule applies only to a window or door attached to this surface that is specified usingAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningorAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening.
(The discussion under the field Window/Door Opening Factor in this object describes how the actual opening area of a window or door in a particular timestep is determined.)
Modulation of Openings
The following five fields can be used to modulate this window/door opening when Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature or Enthalpy. These fields determine a factor between 0 and 1 that multiplies the opening factor of this window or door according to the control action shown in Figure5for Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature and in Figure6for Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. Modulation of this opening can reduce the large temperature swings that can occur if the window/door is open too far when it is venting, especially when there is a large inside-outside temperature difference.
The modulation takes the following form when Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature:
ifT- T< = [Lower Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor = 1.0
if[Lower Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor] < T- T< [Upper Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor varies linearly from 1.0 to [Limit Value on Multiplier for Modulating Venting Open Factor]
ifT- T> =   [Upper Value on Inside/Outside Temperature Difference for Modulating the Venting Open Factor]thenMultiplication factor = [Limit Value on Multiplier for Modulating Venting Open Factor]
One way of “tuning” the following modulation control parameters is to perform a sensitivity analysis for winter and/or summer design days to determine what combination of values causes the biggest reduction in zone air temperature fluctuations due to venting.
Note that the default values for the following fields are such that, if none of the fields are specified, modulation will not occur.
Field: Minimum Venting Open Factor
See Figure5or Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature or Enthalpy. This value may be from zero to 1.0, with the default being 0.0.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Temperature Difference Lower Limit For Maximum Venting Open Factor
See Figure5. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature. This value may be from zero to less than 100°C, with the default being 0°C. The value for this field must be less than the value specified for the following field.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Temperature Difference Upper Limit for Minimun Venting Open Factor
See Figure5. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Temperature. This value must be greater than 0°C, with the default being 100°C. The value for this field must be greater than the value specified for the previous field.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Enthalpy Difference Lower Limit For Maximum Venting Open Factor
See Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. This value may be from zero to less than 300,000 J/kg, with the default being 0 J/kg. The value for this field must be less than the value specified for the following field.
Field: Indoor and Outdoor Enthalpy Difference Upper Limit for Minimun Venting Open Factor
See Figure6. This field applies only if Ventilation Control Mode = Enthalpy. This value must be greater than zero, with the default being 300,000 J/kg. The value for this field must be greater than the value specified for the previous field.
Field: Venting Availability Schedule Name
The name of a schedule that specifies when venting is available. A zero or negative schedule value means venting is not allowed. A value greater than zero means venting can occur if other venting control conditions (specified by Ventilation Control Mode and Vent Temperature Schedule Name) are satisfied. This schedule name should not be confused with Vent Temperature Schedule Name. If the surface is an air boundary(Construction:AirBoundary)then this field is ignored and venting is always available.
If a Venting Availability Schedule Name is not specified, it is assumed that venting is always available.
Using Venting Availability Schedule allows you to turn off venting at certain times of the day (at night, for example), week (on weekends, for example), or year (during the winter, for example).
If used with Ventilation Control Mode = Constant, the ventilation rate is constant only when this schedule allows venting; otherwise the ventilation rate is set to zero.
If Ventilation Control Mode = NoVent, this schedule has no effect.
Note:In order to establish an airflow network, eachAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject must have at least two surfaces defined withAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects, so that air can flow from one zone into other zones (or to outdoors) through the network (air mass flow conserved). In addition, for allAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobjects facing the sameZoneName (ref.BuildingSurface:Detailed),at least two different environments must be defined for the other side of these surfaces (e.g., an external node and an adjacent zone, two adjacent zones, or two external nodes).
Field: Occupant Ventilation Control Name
The name of an AirlowNetwork:OccupantVentilationControl object. The object is used to perform advanced window opening control based on occupant conditions. When an object name is given, advanced window opening control is performed and, the Ventilation Control defined in the Ventilation Control Mode field will be overridden.
Field: Equivalent Rectangle Method
This field is applied to a non-rectangular window or door. The equivalent rectangular surface has the same area as the non-rectangular one. The valid choices are: PolygonHeight, BaseSurfaceAspectRatio, and UserDefinedAspectRatio, with the default of PolygonHeight. When PolygonHeight is entered, the equivalent width is equal to the area divided by the PolygonHeight for a non-horizontal surface. When a surface is horizontal with the same height for all vertices, the model will automatically switch a choice to BaseSurfaceAspectRatio if a base surface is rectangular, or UserDefinedAspectRatio with the default value if a base surface is non-rectangular. When BaseSurfaceAspectRatio is entered for a rectangular base surface, the equivalent height is equal to Square Root of Area divided by the base surface aspect ratio. The equivalent width is equal to the equivalent height times the base surface aspect ratio. When a base surface is non-rectangular, the model will automatically switch the choice to PolygonHeight for a non-horizontal base surface, and UserDefinedAspectRatio with the default value if a base surface is horizontal. When UserDefinedAspectRatio is entered, the equivalent height is equal to Square Root of Area divided by UserDefinedAspectRatio.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:SpecifiedFlowRate
The specified flow object is used to specify flow through a surface. The object has three fields and will cause the mass flowto be set appropriately aswhen the mass flow rateis specified or aswhen the volume flow rateis specified. A positive value of the flow directs the flow from node 1 of the linkage to node 2, and a negative value directs the flow from node 2 to node 1 of the linkage. For surface linkages that are part of the building envelope, a positive value means flow from inside to the outdoors (exfiltration) and a negative value is a flow from the outside to inside (infiltration).
Inputs
Field: Name
This is a name for this object. It is referenced by anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject.
Field: Air Flow Value
This numeric field is used to input the flow rateor. The units of the value are determined by the following field.
Field: Air Flow Units
This choice field determines the units of the air flow value. Two options are available, “kg/s” and “m3/s”.
An IDF example is shown below:

  SpecMassFlow,         !- Name of specified flow component

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening
This object specifies the properties of air flow through windows and doors (window, door and glass door heat transfer subsurfaces) when they are closed or open. The fields are similar to those for AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:SurfaceCrack object when the window or door is closed, but additional fields are required to describe the air flow characteristics when the window or door is open. These additional fields include opening type, opening dimensions, degree of opening, and opening schedule.
The AirflowNetwork model assumes that open windows or doors are vertical or close to vertical; for this reason they are called “Large Vertical Openings.” Such openings can have air flow moving simultaneously in two different directions depending on stack effects and wind conditions (for example, flow from inside to outside at the top of a window and from outside to inside at the bottom). AirflowNetwork models such two-directional flow, but only for vertical openings.
It is assumed that the air flow through a window opening is unaffected by the presence of a shading device such as a shade or blind on the window. Also, the calculation of conductive heat transfer and solar gain through a window or door assumes that the window or door is closed.
The AirflowNetwork model does not have a model for bi-directional flow through large horizontal openings in exterior surfaces. For this reason,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningshould not be used for exterior horizontal openings. The best modeling technique in this case is to put anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject in a horizontal surface and use a large air mass flow coefficient. Crack flow is assumed to be uni-directional in any given timestep (but can reverse flow direction from timestep to timestep).
For large horizontal openings in interior surfaces, seeAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening.
A subsurface multiplier may be used to represent multiple subsurfaces and calculates total air flow when the subsurface (window, glassdoor, or door) is either closed or open. The total airflow across the surface is equal to the airflow based on the surface geometry multiplied by the subsurface multiplier.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of thisAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningobject. It is referenced by anAirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surfaceobject.
Field: Air Mass Flow Coefficient When Opening is Closed
Crack flow is assumed when the window or door is closed. The units for this air mass flow coefficient () are different from the units for(kg/s at 1 Pa pressure difference) defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject. There is no default but the entered value must be greater than zero. The program will automatically generate four cracks around the perimeter of the window or door-one along the bottom, one along the top, and one on each side. The temperature correction factor used in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crackobject is not used for this component to calculate air mass flow rate.
Field: Air Mass Flow Exponent When Opening Is Closed
Crack flow is assumed when the window or door is closed. In this case, the value of this field is the exponent,n, in the crack air flow equation. The valid range for this exponent is 0.5 to 1.0, with the default value being 0.65. Mass Flow Rate = Air Mass Flow Coefficient (deltaP) Air Mass Flow Exponent.
Field: Type of Rectanguler Large Vertical Opening (LVO)
This alpha field specifies the type of rectangular window or door. (Open windows or doors are also called Large Vertical Openings (LVOs). The choices for the opening type areNonPivoted(LVO Type 1) andHorizontallyPivoted(LVO Type 2) with the default beingNonPivoted. The NonPivoted type represents a regular window or door. The HorizontallyPivoted type represents a window with a horizontal axis (i.e., a horizontally-pivoting window) and cannot be used for a door.
Field: Extra Crack Length or Height of Pivoting Axis
Specifies window or door characteristics that depend on the LVO type.
For LVO Type 1 (rectangular non-pivoted windows and doors) this field is the extra crack length in meters due to multiple openable parts, if present. “Extra” here means in addition to the length, calculated by the program, of the cracks on the top, bottom and sides of the window/door.
For LVO Type 2 (rectangular horizontally-pivoted windows) this field gives the height of the pivoting axis measured from the bottom of the glazed part of the window (m).
Field: Number of Sets of Opening Factor Data
This is the number of the following sets of data for opening factor, discharge coefficient, width factor, height factor, and start height factor. From two to four of these sets must be defined. The first set should be for Opening Factor = 0.0 and the last set should be for Opening Factor = 1.0. For example, if only two sets are defined, the first set should be for Opening Factor = 0.0 and the second set should be for Opening Factor = 1.0, as shown below in the IDF example below.
An “opening factor” refers to the amount that a window or door is opened. The program linearly interpolates each timestep between the values of discharge coefficient, width factor, etc., in these sets using the opening factor for the window or door for the timestep. (See discussion under the field Window/Door Opening Factor in theAirflowNetwork:Multizone:Zoneobject for a description of how the AirflowNetwork model determines the time-step value of the opening factor.)
Field Group: Opening Factor, Discharge Coefficient, Width Factor, Height Factor, Start Height Factor
Each field is described for as many groups as required in the previous field (number of sets of opening factor data). As the final field has specific requirements, this field (n) will be described.
Field: Opening Factor 11
The first opening factor of a window or door. This value must be 0.0. The default value is also 0.0.
For LVO Type 1 (rectangular non-pivoted window or door), the Opening Factor corresponds to the fraction of window or door that is opened.
For LVO Type 2 (rectangular horizontally-pivoted windows), the Opening Factor is determined by the window opening angle. For example, an opening angle of 45° corresponds to an Opening Factor of 0.50 since the maximum opening angle is 90°.
Field: Discharge Coefficient for Opening Factor 1
The discharge coefficient of the window or door for Opening Factor 1. The range is greater than 0.0 to less than or equal to 1.0. The default value is 0.001. The Discharge Coefficient indicates the fractional effectiveness for air flow through a window or door at that Opening Factor.
Note:In the following, “window width” and “window height” are glazing dimensions; they do not include the frame, if present.
Field: Width Factor for Opening Factor 1
The Width Factor of the rectangular window or door for Opening Factor 1. The Width Factor is the opening width divided by the window or door width (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default value is 0.0. Note that the width factor applies to rectangular windows or doors where the width is assumed constant along the entire height of the opening.
Field: Height Factor for Opening Factor 1
The Height Factor of the rectangular window or door for Opening Factor 1. The Height Factor is the opening height divided by the window or door height (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default value is 0.0. Note that the height factor applies to rectangular windows or doors where the height is assumed constant along the entire width of the opening.
Field: Start Height Factor for Opening Factor 1
The Start Height Factor of the window or door for Opening Factor 1. The Start Height Factor is the Start Height divided by the window or door height (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default is 0. Start Height is the distance between the bottom of the window or door and the bottom of the window or door opening. The sum of the Height Factor and the Start Height Factor must be less than 1.0 in order to have the opening within the window or door dimensions.
Window (or door) showing geometrical factors associated with an opening through which air flows.[fig:window-or-door-showing-geometrical-factors]
Field: Opening Factor <n>
When Number of Sets of Opening Factor Data = n, the value of Opening Factor n must be set to 1.0.
Field: Discharge Coefficient for Opening Factor <n>
The discharge coefficient of the window or door for Opening Factor n. The range is greater than 0.0 to less than or equal to 1.0. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Width Factor for Opening Factor <n>
The Width Factor of the rectangular window or door for Opening Factor n. The Width Factor is the opening width divided by the window or door width (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Height Factor for Opening Factor <n>
The Height Factor of the rectangular window or door for Opening Factor n. The Height Factor is the opening height divided by the window or door height (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default value is 1.0.
Field: Start Height Factor for Opening Factor <n>
The Start Height Factor of the window or door for Opening Factor n. The Start Height Factor is the Start Height divided by the window or door height (see Figure7). The range is 0.0 to 1.0. The default is 0.
When the opening factor value (as described under the field Window/Door Opening Factor in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject) is between two Opening Factor field values, the values of Discharge Coefficient, Width Factor, Height Factor, and Start Height Factor are linearly interpolated.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening
This object specifies the properties of air flow through windows, doors and glass doors (heat transfer subsurfaces defined as a subset ofFenestrationSurface:Detailedobjects) when they are closed or open. This AirflowNetwork model assumes that these openings are horizontal or close to horizontal and are interzone surfaces. The second and third input fields are similar to those forAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,when the window or door is closed, but additional information is required to describe the air flow characteristics when the window or door is open. This additional information is specified in the last two input fields. The airflow across the opening consists of two types of flows: forced and buoyancy. The forced flow is caused by the pressure difference between two zones, while the buoyancy flow only occurs when the air density in the upper zone is greater than the air density in the lower zone. This opening also allows for the possibility of two-way flow when forced and buoyancy flows co-exist. This object's openness can also be modulated based on the same opening factor control as anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningobject. However, the opening factor is only applied to the subsurface width. The opening width is equal to opening factor multiplied by the subsurface width.
A subsurface multiplier may be used to represent multiple subsurfaces and calculates total air flow when the subsurface (window, glassdoor, or door) is either closed or open. The total airflow across the surface is equal to the airflow based on the surface geometry multiplied by the subsurface multiplier.
Inputs

This is a name for thisAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpeningobject. It is referenced by anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject.
Field: Air Mass Flow Coefficient When Opening is Closed
The value of the air mass flow coefficient,, in the horizontal opening air flow equation. It has units of kg/s-m at 1Pa. The temperature correction factor is not applied to the mass flow calculation. This is a required input field and the entered value must be greater than zero.
Field: Air Mass Flow Exponent When Opening is Closed
The value of the exponent,n, in the crack air flow equation. The valid range is 0.5 to 1.0, with the default value being 0.65.
Field: Sloping Plane Angle
This numeric field is used to represent the angle between the horizontal plane and a sloped plane under the horizontal opening. Sloping plane angle = 90 is equivalent to fully open. The valid range is >0 to 90, with the default value being 90.
Field: Discharge Coefficient
This numeric field is used to input the discharge coefficient. This is a required field and the entered value must be greater than zero.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening
This object specifies the properties of air flow through windows, doors and glass doors (heat transfer subsurfaces) when they are closed or open. The AirflowNetwork model assumes that open windows or doors are vertical or close to vertical. The second and third fields are similar to those forAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,when the window or door is closed, but additional information is required to describe the air flow characteristics when the window or door is open. This additional information is specified in the last two fields. Compared to the objectAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,which requires more inputs at different opening factors, this object needs comparatively less inputs. For this reason it is called a simple opening. This opening also allows for the possibility of two-way flow due to temperature and resulting density differences. Therefore, it is possible to have a positive pressure difference at the top of the opening, and a negative pressure difference at the bottom (or vice versa) when the neutral height is between the bottom and top heights of the associated surface. This object's openness can also be modulated based on the same opening factor control as anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpeningobject. However, the opening factor is only applied to the subsurface width. The opening width is equal to opening factor multiplied by the subsurface width.
A subsurface multiplier may be used to represent multiple subsurfaces and calculates total air flow when the subsurface (window, glassdoor, or door) is either closed or open. The total airflow across the surface is equal to the airflow based on the surface geometry multiplied by the subsurface multiplier.
Inputs

Field: Air Mass Flow Coefficient When Opening is Closed
The value of the air mass flow coefficient,, in the simple opening air flow equation. It has units of kg/s-m at 1Pa. The temperature correction factor is not applied for mass flow calculation.
Field: Air Mass Flow Exponent When Opening is Closed
The value of the exponent, n, in the crack air flow equation. The valid range is 0.5 to 1.0, with the default value being 0.65. Mass Flow Rate = Air Mass Flow Coefficient(deltaP)^Air Mass Flow Exponent.
Field: Minimum Density Difference for Two-Way Flow
This numeric field is used to input the minimum density difference above which two-way or one way flow may occur due to stack effect with the window being open. Two-way flow occurs only when the neutral plane is within the opening. Density differences less than this value result in one-way flow only with the window being closed. The minimum value for this field is greater than zero.
Field: Discharge Coefficient
This numeric field is used to input the discharge coefficient. This value must be greater than zero.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFan
This object specifies the properties of air flow through an exterior heat transfer surface with a zone exhaust fan. The zone exhaust fan turns on or off based on the availability schedule defined in the correspondingFan:ZoneExhaustobject. When the exhaust fan mass flow rate is greater than zero, the airflow network model treats this object as a constant volume fan. When the fan is off based on the availability schedule, the model treats this object as a crack.
When the fan is on, the air mass flow rate modeled for the airflow network is based on the value defined in the MaximumFlow Rate field of theFan:ZoneExhaustobject. The airflow direction is from the corresponding zone to outdoors.
When the fan is off, the following power law form is used that gives air flow through the crack as a function of the pressure difference across the crack:

Where
Q= air mass flow (kg/s)
C= air mass flow coefficient (kg/s-Pa@ 1 Pa)
C= reference condition temperature correction factor (dimensionless)

The name of theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ReferenceCrackConditionsobject which specifies the conditions under which the air mass flow coefficient was measured. If the user omits this field and only oneAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ReferenceCrackConditionsobject is defined in the input data file, then those reference crack conditions will be used. If the user omits this field and either zero or more than oneAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ReferenceCrackConditionsobjects are defined in the input data file, then the default conditions for the AirflowNetwork:MultiZone: Reference Crack Conditions object will be used.

AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNode
External nodes in the AirflowNetwork model define environmental conditions outside of the building. These conditions include wind pressure coefficients that vary from façade to façade and can be highly dependent on the building geometry.
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects donothave to be entered if Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject.
Inputs
Field: Name
The external node name is associated with a particular building façade. This name is referenced by the External Node Name field of anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject.
Field: External Node Height
Designates the reference height, in meters, used to calculate relative pressure. The default value is 0 meters.
Field: Wind Pressure Coefficient Curve Name
The name of a specificAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobject, curve, or table (which gives wind pressure coefficients for the façade as a function of angle of wind incident on the façade). Curves or tables should have the domain of 0 to 180 degrees or 0 to 360 degrees, depending upon the symmetry field (see below).
Field: Symmetric Wind Pressure Coefficient Curve
Specifies the symmetry of the above named curve. The default is No, meaning that the curve will be evaluated from 0 to 360 degrees. Specify Yes for a curve that is symmetric about zero and is evaluated only up to 180 degrees. For this type of curve, an angle of 270 degrees is passed to the curve as 90 degrees.
Field: Wind Angle Type
Specifies which wind angle should be used to calculate the wind pressure coefficient. The default is Absolute, meaning that the absolute wind direction angle will be used. Specifying Relative means that the angle will be relative to the surface normal. For a surface facing due east, the angle 0 corresponds to wind blowing perpendicular to and at the surface with absolute direction 90 degrees, while 90 degrees corresponds to wind blowing parallel to the surface from the right (facing outward) with an absolute direction of 180 degrees.

The reference height and wind directions are first specified under theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientArrayobject. The user may specify up to 36 different wind directions in ascending order. These are then referenced byAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobjects defined for eachAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNode.

In the air flow calculation, interpolation of the specified WPC values is done for time-step values of wind direction.
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobjects need to be entered only if the Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = INPUT in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject. If Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation, this object is not required and is not used.
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of this WindPressureCoefficientValues object. This name can be referenced by multipleAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobjects.
Field: WindPressureCoefficientArray Name

Field: Wind Pressure Coefficient Value 1 to Wind Pressure Coefficient Value N
The WPC (wind pressure coefficient) value for the building façade indicated by the External Node Name field above. This WPC value corresponds to the first wind direction in theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientArray.Note that WPC values can be positive, negative or zero.
Obtaining WPC values
WPC values can be obtained from wind tunnel measurements, CFD calculations, or from published values for different building shapes.
Forrectangular buildingsEnergyPlus will automatically calculate surface-averaged Cp values for the walls and roof of the building if you specify Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = SurfaceAverageCalculation in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject. In this case you do not have to enter anyAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:WindPressureCoefficientValuesobjects.
Wind pressure coefficients are reported in the eplusout.eio either from inputs using “INPUT” as the choice for the Wind Pressure Coefficient Type field defined in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject, or from internal calculation using SurfaceAverageCalculation as the choice for the Wind Pressure Coefficient Type field defined in the same object.

AirflowNetwork:OccupantVentilationControl
TheAirflowNetwork:OccupantVentilationControlobject provides control options with minimum opening and closing time checks and opening and closing probability values. In general, the probability values could be a constant or a specific function. Due to lack of real data, two schedules are selected to represent probability values. If real data are available, this object may be modified to adopt new data.

This curve is a linear or quadratic equation using outdoor dry-bulb temperatures as an independent variable. This performance curve can be used to describe the thermal comfort temperature at low outdoor dry-bulb temperature. It allows maximum two curves to describe the thermal comfort temperature in two different outdoor dry-bulb temperature regions. If a single curve is used, blanks are entered in the following two fields.
Field: Thermal Comfort Temperature Boundary Point
When there are two piecewise curves to represent thermal comfort temperature calculation, this field represents a boundary point of outdoor dry-bulb temperature.

AirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureController
TheAirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureControllerobject is used to control a zone to a specified indoor level of pressure using the AirflowNetwork model. The specified pressure setpoint is used to calculate the required zone exhaust fan flow rate in a controlled zone or relief air flow rate in an AirLoop.
The object has a similar function asZoneControl:Thermostat.When an AirLoop serves multiple zones, the controlled zone will reach the specified setpoint, while other zones will not be controlled precisely.
Inputs
Field: Name
Unique identifying name for theAirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureController.
Field: Control Zone Name
Name of the zone that is being controlled.
Field: Control Object Type
This field specifies the control type to be used for pressure control. Available control types are:AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:ZoneExhaustFanandAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:ReliefAirFlow.
Field: Control Object Name
The corresponding control object name.
Field: Pressure Control Availability Schedule Name
This field contains the name of a schedule that determines whether or not theAirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureControlleris available. When the schedule value is zero, theAirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureControlleris bypassed (not available to operate). When the schedule value is greater than zero, theAirflowNetwork:ZoneControl:PressureControlleris available to perform pressure control. When AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:ZoneExhaustFan in entered in the Control Object Type field, the model will calculate the required zone exhaust fan airflow rate to reach the pressure setpoint. When anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:ReliefAirFlowis entered in the Control Object Type field, the model will calculate the central relief flow rate in an outdoor air mixer. If this field is left blank, the schedule has a value of 1 for all time periods. Schedule values must be between 0 and 1.

AirflowNetwork with RoomAir Models
The next two objects ofAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:NodeandAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Linkageare used withRoomAir:Node:AirflowNetworkobjects together to simulate multiple internal airflows via multiple intrazone nodes and linkages in a thermal zone. The mixed-air assumption for zone air conditions is not always appropriate. EnergyPlus includes several RoomAir models that can model the implications for different flow patterns on variations in temperature within the zone. However none of them are generalized enough for different types of air flow situations and none are coupled tightly with AirflowNetwork. A general RoomAir model based on pressure network solver will allow modeling a variety of spaces types not currently covered by existing models such as tall spaces.
Recent advancements have been made to AirflowNetwork to model large horizontal openings. This new development makes AirflowNetwork useful for not only modeling air movement between zones (and outdoors), but also within individual thermal zones.
The possible combination will allow the EnergyPlus to simulate a thermal zone using a network approach by assuming internal nodes connected by user-defined patterns of temperatures and airflows. It should be pointed out that the new model works when the MultiZoneWithoutDistribution is selected in the field of AirflowNetwork Control of the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject. The model cannot work with other choices.
AirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Node
This object allows users to input multiple nodes in a zone. A single object represent a node. If there is only one node per zone, then use theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneinput object. The zone node is not defined in this object.
Field: Name
The name identifies the node for later reference and in the output listing. Each node should have a unique name. This name can be referenced as AirflowNetworkNodeNames.
Field: RoomAir:Node:AirflowNetwork Name
The name of aRoomAir:Node:AirflowNetworkobject, which is also defined in aRoomAirSettings:AirflowNetworkobject (zone based).
Field: Zone Name
The name of a zone object, which is also defined in aAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject (zone based).
Field: Node Height
This field requires input of node height in meters.

AirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Linkage
The input object specifies a connection between twoAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Nodeobjects and an AiflowNetwork component defined elsewhere. The object also allow users to specify a connection between anAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Nodeand an adjacent zone defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject. This object provides flexibility to define a linkage either in the same zone or in two different zones.
Field: Name
The name identifies the linkage for later reference and in the output listing. Each linkage should have a unique name.
Field: Node 1 Name
The input designates a node name where airflow starts. The node name should be defined in anAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Nodeobject or anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject.
Field: Node 2 Name
The input designates a node name where airflow ends. The node name should be defined in anAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Nodeobject or anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject.
Note: One of Node 1 and Node 2 should be defined as anAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Nodeobject. In other words, both nodes cannot be defined asAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobject. This type of connection should be defined as anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject.
Field: Component Name
The input designates an AirflowNetwork component name associated with the two nodes. The component name should be one of the AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component object names. The component is used for intrazone node connection only. If the next field is specified, the input of this field could be a blank.
It should be pointed out that anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject allows following five AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component objects:
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:DetailedOpening,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:SimpleOpening,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component:HorizontalOpening
However, anAirflowNetwork:IntraZone:Linkageobject without a surface connection has connection with two intrazone nodes in the same zone and allows two AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Component objects due to lack of geometry inputs.
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:Crack,
AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface:EffectiveLeakageArea,
Field: Connection Surface
The input specifies anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject name, when the nodes defined above are not located in the same zone. The surface linkage will be connected by the above two nodes, instead of zone nodes in normal definition. In other words, the connection defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceis removed. Instead, this new connection replaces the the connection specified before. A warning message is issued to let users be aware of the changes. Since eachAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surfaceobject has its own component defined in the Leakage Component Name field, the input of the Component Name field in this object will be ignored.

The previous sections of this AirflowNetwork model discussion describe input objects used for multizone airflow calculations. The following sections describe input objects used for air distribution system simulations. These objects work when control option “MultiZone with Distribution” or “MultiZone with Distribution Only During Fan Operation” is defined in the AirflowNetwork Control field in the AirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject.
The first section presents the input object for distribution system nodes. Although thermal zones are required to perform air distribution system simulations, the thermal zones are already defined in the multizone input section (described previously), so that there is no need to repeat the inputs for thermal zones when modeling an air distribution system. The same is also true for surface air leakage. This section has only one object:AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Node.
AirflowNetwork:Distribution:DuctViewFactors
TheAirflowNetwork:Distribution:DuctViewFactorsobject is used to represent the information needed for simplified surface-to-duct radiation heat transfer. View factors from each duct object to each referenced surface are provided by the user. EnergyPlus calculates the heat gain to the duct from the referenced surfaces. If the object is included, radiation is calculated for the referenced duct; radiation is neglected of the object is omitted.
Field: Name of Linkage
Name of the linkage object in which the view factors are applied.
Field: Surface Exposure Fraction
The fraction, range 0 to 1, of the duct surface that is exposed to the zone for a partially buried duct (dimensionless).
Field: Surface Emittance
The air duct surface emittance factor in the range 0 to 1 based on the material properties (dimensionless).
Field: Surface <#> Name
This field specifies the name of the surface seen by the duct.
Field: View Factor <#>
This field specifies the view factor from the duct to the surface.
This object is extensible, so additional pairs of the last two fields can be added to the end of this object.

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Node
TheAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobject is used to represent air distribution system nodes for the AirflowNetwork model. The EnergyPlus nodes defined in anAirLoopHVACare a subset of the nodes used to simulate the distribution system using the AirflowNetwork model. For example, the inlet node of a fan and the outlet node of a coil defined in anAirLoopHVACmust be defined as nodes using theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobject. A set of EnergyPlusZoneEquipment nodes is also a subset of the AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodes. For example, zone inlet and outlet nodes must be defined as nodes using the AirflowNetwork:Distribution: Node object. In addition, although mixers and splitters are defined as objects with inlet and outlet nodes within EnergyPlus, theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobject treats mixers and splitters as single nodes. The node objects are referenced byAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobjects.
In summary, all nodes used to define anAirLoopHVAC(except splitters, mixers, and outdoor air systems which are treated as single nodes) and its connections to a thermal zone must be specified as AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodes. If distribution system air leaks are to be modeled, additional AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodes may be defined along with AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Components (e.g., leak or leak ratio) to define the air leakage characteristics.
Note: Supply and return leaks are not allowed in anAirLoopHVAC.They can only be modeled in theZoneEquipment Loop (i.e., return leaks may be modeled between the zone return node and the zone mixer inlet or the zone mixer outlet and the zone equipment loop outlet; and supply leaks may be modeled between the zone equipment loop inlet and theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitterinlet node or theAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitteroutlet node and the zone supply node).
Inputs
Field: Name
The name of an air distribution system node. This node name is referenced by anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageand in the output listing. Each node should have a unique name within theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects (however, the node name may be used elsewhere as regular EnergyPlus node names such as the fan inlet node or coil outlet node).
Field:Component Name or Node Name
Designates node names defined in another EnergyPlus object, so that theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobject is able to get input parameters and node conditions from the associated EnergyPlus node or object. The actual node name is entered here and represents a node already defined in anAirLoopHVACor zone equipment loop. This field is left blank if the EnergyPlus Node Type field below is entered as Mixer, Splitter, Outdoor air System, or Other.
Field: Component Object Type or Node Type
This choice field distinguishes the node type for the EnergyPlus node or object name defined above. Five node types are available:

AirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixer: Represents anAirLoopHVAC:ZoneMixerobject defined in EnergyPlus
AirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitter: Represents anAirLoopHVAC:ZoneSplitterobject defined in EnergyPlus

OAMixerOutdoorAirStreamNode: Represents an external node name specified as an Outdoor Air Stream Node Name in theOutdoorAir:Mixerobject when theAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemobject is used.
OutdoorAir:NodeList: Represents an external node name defined in theOutdoorAir:NodeListobject when theAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemobject and an exhaust energy recovery system (air-to-air heat exchanger) are used.
OutdoorAir: Represents an external node name defined in theOutdoorAir:Nodeobject when theAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemand an exhaust energy recovery system (air-to-air heat exchanger) are used.

Note: Both theOutdoorAir:NodeListandOutdoorAir:Nodenode types represent a node to outdoor air conditions. Either one of these node types can be used to represent an external node when an air-to-air heat exchanger is used to recover energy from the exhaust air stream as part of anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemobject. Node type OAMixerOutdoorAirStreamNode does not represent an external node when anOutdoorAir:NodeListorOutdoorAir:Nodeobject is specified. If no exhaust heat recovery system (i.e., air-to-air heat exchanger) is specified in theAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystem,the node type OAMixerOutdoorAirStreamNode represents an external node.

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Leak
This component may be also called a power law component and is used to represent a supply or return air leak in an air distribution system. Its relationship between pressure difference and airflow may be expressed as:

where
= Air mass flow rate through the component [kg/s]
C = Air mass flow coefficient (kg/s at 1 Pa pressure difference)
= Total pressure loss across the element [Pa]
n = Air mass flow exponent
C= Temperature correction factor

where
= Air density at the specific air temperature and humidity ratio conditions [kg/m]
= Air kinetic viscosity at the specific air temperature condition [m/s]
= Air density at air conditions of 20°C, 0 kg/kg and 101325 Pa [kg/m]
= Air kinetic viscosity at an air temperature of 20°C [m/s]
Note: The correction factor shown above is use for this particular component as specified.
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique name identifying a supply or return air leak in an air distribution system. This unique name will be referenced by anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject to represent a component leak.
Field: Air Mass Flow Coefficient
This numeric field is defined as the air mass flow coefficient at 1 Pa pressure difference across this component. Valid entries must be greater than zero.
Field: Air Mass Flow Exponent
This numeric field is defined as the pressure difference exponent across the component. Valid entries are from 0.5 to 1.0, with the default value being 0.65.
An IDF example is provided below:
AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Leak,
  MainSupplyLeak,       !- Name of Supply or Return Leak
  0.0001,               !- Air Mass Flow Coefficient {kg/s}

  ZoneSupplyLeak,       !- Name of Supply or Return Leak
  0.01,                 !- Air Mass Flow Coefficient {kg/s}
  0.65;                 !- Air Mass Flow Exponent {dimensionless}
AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:LeakageRatio
The leakage ratio component is generally used to define supply and return leaks with respect to a constant fan flow. This object requires 5 inputs. The relationship between pressure and airflow may be expressed as a power law element:

where
= Air density [kg/m]
= Total pressure loss across the element [Pa]
= Air mass flow exponent
= Equivalent air mass flow coefficient

where
= Effective leakage ratio [dimensionless]
= Maximum airflow rate [m/s]
= Reference pressure difference [Pa]
= Air mass flow exponent [dimensionless]
The above calculation is valid only for a HVAC system using a constant volume supply fan:Fan:ConstantVolumeorFan:OnOff.
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique name identifying a supply or return air leak (ratio with respect to the constant volume fan flow rate) in an air distribution system. This unique name will be referenced in anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject to represent a component.
Field: Effective Leakage Ratio
This numeric field is used to input the effective leakage ratio. This value must be greater than zero and less than or equal to 1. The effective leakage ratio is used to characterize supply and return leaks with respect to the constant fan flow (supply or return air leak flow rate divided by the maximum air flow rate for the fan). When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, the ratio for a supply leak is defined as the value of supply air leak flow rate divided by the supply fan air flow rate at the current time step. The inputs of the rest of 3 fields are not used.
Field: Maximum Flow Rate
This numeric field is used to input the maximum flow rate for a constant volume fan [m/s]. This value must be greater than 0 m/s. When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, this input is not used, because the real supply fan flow rate at the current time step is used to calculate the amount of a supply leak.
Field: Reference Pressure Difference
This numeric field is used to input the reference pressure difference [Pa]. This value must be greater than 0 Pa. When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, this input is not used, because the real supply fan flow rate at the current time step is used to calculate the amount of a supply leak.
Field: Air Mass Flow Exponent
This numeric field is used to input the pressure difference exponent. The value of the exponent can be from 0.5 to 1.0, with the default value being 0.65. When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, this input is not used, because the real supply fan flow rate at the current time step is used to calculate the amount of a supply leak.
Note: The reference pressure difference is defined as the difference between pressures of originate and terminate nodes for supply and return leaks. In general, it may require that a simulation be performed with an initial guess for reference pressure difference using design day conditions. After obtaining pressures at the leakage nodes, more realistic reference pressure differences can be entered. It should be pointed out that since pressures at the nodes vary with temperature and other conditions, the effective leakage ratio is only an estimate. In other words, the exact leakage ratio may not be available.
When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:LeakageRatioobject has to be used to define a supply leak. The other components cannot be used. In addition, the first node in aAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageto define a supply leak has to be the node in the duct to originate a supply leak, and the second node has to be the node of a zone to terminate a supply leak. In other words, the supply leak has to flow from node 1 to node 2.  When this object is used to define a return leak, the first node in aAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkagehas to be a thermal zone to originate a leak, and the second node has to be the node of a duct to terminate a leak.

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Duct
This object represents a duct component and requires 9 input fields, one alpha field and 8 numeric fields. An additional two fields can be used to define the convection coefficients on the inner and outer surfaces of the duct. The relationship between pressure and airflow across the component may be expressed as (2001 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 34):

Field: Inside Convection Coefficient
This numeric field defines the inside convection coefficient (W/m-K). If the field is omitted, the film coeffient is calculated automatically as described in ASTM C1340.

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fan
This component represents a constant or variable volume fan in the air distribution system(AirLoopHVAC).The air flow rate and air conditions (temperature and humidity) are obtained from the associatedFan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,Fan:VariableVolume,orFan:SystemModelobject.
Inputs

An advanced fan model forFan:SystemModelis also allowed.
Note: Make sure that the volumetric air flow rates for the fan, coils, and parent components (e.g., unitary system or furnace) are the same so that fan energy and air distribution system losses/gains are properly calculated.

Inputs
Field: Coil Name

A =Ductcross section area [m]
P = Perimeter of cross section [m]
For this component, the relationship between airflow and pressure is similar to the componentAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Duct.However, the model assumes very small surface roughness (10) and no local dynamic loss due to fittings for this component. Therefore, this component only requires two numerical fields. Heat and moisture exchange from surroundings is ignored.
Note: Make sure that the volumetric air flow rates for the fan, coils, and parent components (e.g., unitary system or furnace) are the same so that fan energy and air distribution system losses/gains are properly calculated.

AirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:HeatExchanger
This component represents an air-to-air heat exchanger typically used in combination with a cooling coil to enhance dehumidification or in an outside air system to recover energy from exhaust air to pretreat incoming outdoor ventilation air. The cooling coils with enhanced dehumidification are defined in the two objectsCoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssistedandCoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssistedusing one of three heat exchanger objects specified below. The exhaust air energy recovery system also has the same restriction using the one of three heat exchanger objects. The main purpose for this object is to obtain calculated values (air flow and temperature/humidity conditions) from the associated heat exchanger models for the airflow network calculations.
Inputs
Field: Heat Exchanger Name
The name identifying an AirflowNetwork heat exchanger defined in an air loop. This name must be the same name that is used in the associated heat exchanger object. This unique name will be referenced by anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject to represent a component.
Field: Heat Exchanger Object Type
This field requires input of the heat exchanger type. The available choices are:
HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlateHeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatentHeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow
HeatExchanger:AirToAir:FlatPlate
HeatExchanger:AirToAir:SensibleAndLatent
HeatExchanger:Desiccant:BalancedFlow
Field: Air Path Length
This numeric field is used to input air path length for the heat exchanger coil [m]. This value must be greater than 0 meters.
Field: Air Path Hydraulic Diameter
This numeric field is used to input hydraulic diameter of a heat exchanger coil's air path, which is defined as:

where
D= Hydraulic diameter [m]
A =Ductcross section area [m]
P = Perimeter of cross section [m]
For this component, the relationship between airflow and pressure is similar to the componentAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Duct.However, the model assumes very small surface roughness (10) and no local dynamic loss due to fittings for this component. Therefore, this component only requires two numerical fields. Heat and moisture exchange from surroundings are ignored.
Note: When a heat exchanger is used as a component of eitherCoilSystem:Cooling:DX:HeatExchangerAssistedorCoilSystem:Cooling:Water:HeatExchangerAssisted,the heat exchanger acts as two components in an air primary loop. For example, an air-to-air heat exchanger has a component connected to the supply air side (equivalent to a supply coil) and a component connected to exhaust air side (equivalent to an exhaust coil). The desiccant heat exchanger has a component connected to regeneration air side (equivalent to a regeneration air coil) and a component connected to process air side (equivalent to a process air coil). Therefore, each air-to-air heat exchanger used in this configuration requires two linkage objects (instead of only one linkage object as required for other AirflowNetwork components).
When a heat exchanger is used in an exhaust air energy recovery system (i.e., in anAirLoopHVAC:OutdoorAirSystemobject to recover waste heat from exhaust air to pretreat incoming outdoor ventilation air), the heat exchanger is treated as a single component. The AirflowNetwork model only connects the two nodes associated with the incoming outdoor ventilation air, while the two exhaust nodes are not defined as part of the AirflowNetwork model. Therefore, each heat exchanger component used in an exhaust air energy recovery system has only one linkage object, similar to AirflowNetwork coil components.

This numeric field is used to input hydraulic diameter for the terminal unit's air path, which is defined as:

where
D= Hydraulic diameter [m]
A =Ductcross section area [m]
P = Perimeter of cross section [m]
It should be noted that the relationship for this component between airflow and pressure is similar to the componentAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Duct.However, the model assumes very small surface roughness (10) and no local dynamic loss due to fittings for this component. Therefore, this component only requires two numerical fields. Heat and moisture exchange from surroundings is ignored.
Note: TheAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:TerminalUnitobject is used to represent anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheator anAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheatobject in an AirflowNetwork simulation. TheAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:TerminalUnitshould not be used to represent any other air terminal unit types. When theZoneHVAC:EquipmentListobject specifies an Air:Terminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat object, theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Ductobject should be used instead.
TheAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheatobject has two components: a damper and a reheat coil. When theAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheattype is used, two objects ofAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkagehave to be used to make two links, one of which is a link to connect two nodes for a damper, and the other is a link to connect two nodes for a reheat coil.
When a VAV system is used with Supply Fan Object Type =Fan:VariableVolumein theAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Component:Fanobject, the type of all terminals has to beAirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat.The object of Air:Terminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:NoReheat is not allowed.

AFN Node Temperature [C]
This is the AirflowNetwork node temperature output in degrees C. When aFan:OnOffobject is used and is scheduled to operate in the cycling fan operation mode, this value forAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects reflects the temperature when the fan is operating (ON).
AFN Node Humidity Ratio [kgWater/kgDryAir]
This is the AirflowNetwork node humidity ratio output in kgWater/kgDryAir. When aFan:OnOffobject is used and is scheduled to operate in the cycling fan operation mode, this value forAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects reflects the humidity ratio when the fan is operating (ON).
AFN Node Total Pressure [Pa]
This is the AirflowNetwork node total pressure in Pa with respect to outdoor barometric pressure. The total pressure is the sum of static pressure, dynamic pressure, and elevation impact at the node's relative height. When aFan:OnOffobject is used and is scheduled to operate in the cycling fan operation mode, the value forAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects reflects the total pressure when the fan is operating (ON). The total pressures for nodes associate withAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Zoneobjects are reported in different output variables (below).
AFN Node CO2 Concentration [ ppm]
This is the AirflowNetwork node carbon dioxide concentration level in parts per million (ppm). When aFan:OnOffobject is used and is scheduled to operate in the cycling fan operation mode, this value forAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects reflects the carbon dioxide when the fan is operating (ON).
AFN Node Generic Air Contaminant Concentration [ppm]
This is the AirflowNetwork node generic contaminant concentration level in parts per million (ppm). When aFan:OnOffobject is used and is scheduled to operate in the cycling fan operation mode, this value forAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Nodeobjects reflects the carbon dioxide when the fan is operating (ON).
AFN Zone Average Pressure [Pa]
This is the AirflowNetwork average zone total pressure in Pa with respect to outdoor barometric pressure. This output is only available when aFan:OnOffobject is used in the air distribution system. The average zone pressure is weighted by the system fan part-load ratio using the calculated zone pressures during the fan on and off periods for the system timestep. The system fan part-load ratio is defined as the ratio of the air distribution system mass flow rate (average for the simulation timestep) to the system design mass flow rate.
Average zone pressure =(Zonepressure during on cycle * Part-load ratio) +Zonepressure during off cycle * (1.0 - Part-load ratio)
AFN Zone On Cycle Pressure [Pa]
This is the AirflowNetwork zone total pressure in Pa with respect to outdoor barometric pressure when the air distribution system fan is operating (ON). This output is only available when aFan:OnOffobject is used in the air distribution system. When the fan part-load ratio is equal to 0.0, this pressure value will be zero because the air distribution system is not simulated when the fan is off for the entire timestep.
AFN Zone Off Cycle Pressure [Pa]
This is the AirflowNetwork zone total pressure in Pa with respect to outdoor barometric pressure when the air distribution system fan is not operating (OFF). This output is only available when aFan:OnOffobject is used in the air distribution system. Even if the fan part-load ratio is equal to 1.0, the pressure calculated as if the fan were not operating (OFF) is reported.
AFN Node Wind Pressure [Pa]
This is the AirflowNetwork wind pressure output in Pa. The wind pressure depends on several factors, including wind speed, wind direction, the wind-pressure coefficient (Cp) values for theAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeassociated with the heat transfer surface and the site wind conditions.
When Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = “Input” in theAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject, the output represents external node pressures driven by wind defined in anAirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ExternalNodeobject. When Wind Pressure Coefficient Type = “SurfaceAverageCalculation” inAirflowNetwork:SimulationControl,the program assumes five external nodes:
FACADE1         Representing north orientationFACADE2         Representing east orientationFACADE3         Representing south orientationFACADE4         Representing west orientationROOFRepresenting horizontal orientation
FACADE1         Representing north orientation
FACADE2         Representing east orientation
FACADE3         Representing south orientation
FACADE4         Representing west orientation
ROOFRepresenting horizontal orientation
In this case, the output represents the wind pressures for the five external nodes defined above.
AFN Linkage Node 1 to Node 2 Mass Flow Rate [kg/s]
This is the AirflowNetwork linkage mass flow rate output in kg/s in the direction from Node 1 to Node 2. It reports surface airflows through a crack or opening, and through linkages defined in anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject. The surface linkage is divided into two types of surfaces, exterior surface and interior surface. Node 1 for an exterior surface linkage is a thermal zone and Node 2 is an external node. The value of AFN Linkage Node 1 to Node 2 Mass Flow Rate represents the flow rate from a thermal zone to outdoors. The flow direction through an interior surface crack or opening is defined from a thermal zone defined by a surface'sZoneName (Node 1) to an adjacent thermal zone defined by a surface's OutsideFaceEnvironment (Node 2). For anAirflowNetwork:Distribution:Linkageobject, the value represents the air mass flow rate flowing from Node 1 to Node 2.
It should be pointed out that in general, each linkage has one directional flow at any given time, either from Node 1 to 2 or from Node 2 to 1.

NOTE:The following output variables should not be confused with similar output variables for the infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing objects (Ref. Infiltration Output, Mixing Output, or Cross Mixing Output). The output variables described below refer to infiltration, mixing, and cross-mixing when an Airflow Network Simulation is performed. The following output variables are always used to describe infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing when the AirflowNetwork Control field in theAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject is set to “MultiZoneWithoutDistribution” or “MultiZoneWithDistribution”. In this case the output variables for the infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing objects will always be 0.
In contrast, the following output variables are only used to describe infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing when the AirflowNetwork Control field in theAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject is set to “MultiZoneAirflowWithDistributionOnlyDuringFanOperation” and the fan is operating. When the fan is not operating, the output variables for the infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing objects are used.
In the case where the AirflowNetwork Control field in theAirflowNetwork:SimulationControlobject is set to “NoMultiZoneOrDistribution”, the following output variables are not used and the output variables for the infiltration, mixing, and cross mixing objects are used instead.
