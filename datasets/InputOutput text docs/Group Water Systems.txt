Group Water Systems
This group of objects is used to describe the water systems in the building. EnergyPlus offers water modeling capabilities that include not only hot water systems but also the overall water systems including cold water uses, on-site water collection (e.g., from rain, condensate, or well), and storage. HVAC components may consume or collect a significant portion of the water making it appropriate to include water modeling in EnergyPlus.
All water systems are collected into an end use category called Water Systems. This category includes hot and cold water. Water consumed by an HVAC component will be assigned to the end use category for that component. End use subcategories are available to separate hot water from cold water if desired. Simple hot water systems can be configured as stand-alone or use aPlantLoop.The Water Systems can be connected to PlantLoops for modeling heated water end uses. However PlantLoops are not used to model cold water and the WaterUse:Storages portions of the water system. Cold water systems are connected together usingWaterUse:Storageobjects.WaterUse:Connectionsare used at the zone level to connect to both cold and hot water.
In addition to the input objects described in this section below, there are a variety of HVAC components that can be configured to interact with the water systems. These component input objects include optional fields that allow describing how the water systems are connected to them by providing the name of a storage tank. The following table lists EnergyPlus input objects that include provisions for connecting to the water systems but are described elsewhere in this document:
WaterUse:Equipment
TheWaterUse:Equipmentobject is a generalized object for simulating all water end uses. Hot and cold water uses are included, as well as controlled mixing of hot and cold water at the tap. TheWaterUse:Equipmentobject can be used stand-alone, or coupled into a plant loop using theWaterUse:Connectionsobject (see below). TheWaterUse:Connectionsobject allows water uses to be linked toWaterUse:Storageobjects to store and draw reclaimed water. TheWaterUse:Connectionsobject can also simulate drainwater heat recovery.
TheWaterUse:Equipmentobject serves all of the same purposes as the existing objects:Exterior:WaterEquipment,andHotWaterEquipment.
TheWaterUse:Equipmentobject does a better job of modeling domestic hot water by allowing mixing at the tap in order to account for both hotand coldwater used at sinks, showers, etc. It also improves on the stand-alone energy modeling of domestic hot water. Because all of the temperatures and flow rates can be solved, the energy usage can be accounted for as “Purchased Heating”.
In either stand-alone mode or used with theWaterUse:Connectionsobject, theWaterUse:Equipmentobject will attempt to meet a scheduled target temperature at the tap by mixing hot and cold water flows. If the hot water flow is not hot enough, or if the flow is limited by plant loop constraints, the result is a cooler mixed water temperature and the target temperature will not be met. In stand-alone mode the hot and cold water temperatures are specified by schedules. However, if the cold water schedule is omitted, the water temperature will be calculated by theSite:WaterMainsTemperatureobject. If the hot water schedule or target temperature schedule are omitted, all water is delivered as cold water. If only using cold water, theWaterUse:Equipmentobject is similar to theExterior:WaterEquipmentobject.
TheWaterUse:Equipmentobject improves on the internal gains objectHotWaterEquipmentby associating actual water usage with a sensible and latent gain to a zone. Equipment, such as showers, that generate a significant heat gain can be modeled using the Sensible Fraction Schedule and Latent Fraction Schedule fields. The schedules are used to set the fraction of the maximum possible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that should be added to the zone. The split between sensible and latent will vary depending on the type of equipment that is to be modeled. Typically, both fractions should be small numbers.
Inputs
Field: Name
The unique object name for reference by other objects.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Laundry”, “Dish Washing”, etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Subcategories are also reported in the ABUPS table under the “Water Systems” end-use category and also appear in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the water use will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.
Field: Peak Flow Rate
The peak demanded hot water flow rate [m/s]. This value is multiplied by the Flow Rate Fraction Schedule (below) to determine the actual volumetric flow rate.
Field: Flow Rate Fraction Schedule Name
Reference to the schedule object specifying the flow rate fraction relative to the Peak Flow Rate (above). If blank, the schedule defaults to 1.0 at all times.
Field: Target Temperature Schedule Name
Reference to the schedule object specifying the target water temperature [C]. Hot and cold water are mixed at the tap to attain the target temperature. If insufficient hot water is available to reach the target temperature, the result is cooler water at the tap. If this field is left blank, the target water temperature can take either the cold water temperature or the hot water temperature depending on a couple of other settings: if no water connection is used, and if the hot water schedule is not set, the target temperature will default to the cold water supply temperature; if there is water connection used for the water use equipment, or there is a hot water schedule present, the target water temperature will default to the hot water supply temperature.
Field: Hot Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name
Reference to the schedule object specifying the hot water temperature [C]. The hot water temperature is used to calculate the “Purchased Heating” energy usage in stand-alone mode. If blank in stand-alone mode, the hot water supply temperature defaults to the cold water supply temperature. This field is ignored if the object is used with theWaterUse:Connectionsobject.
Field: Cold Water Supply Temperature Schedule Name
Reference to the Schedule object specifying the cold water temperature [C] from the supply mains that provides the cold water to the tap and makes up for all water lost down the drain. If blank, water temperatures are calculated by theSite:WaterMainsTemperatureobject. This field is ignored if the object is used with theWaterUse:Connectionsobject.
Field: Zone Name
Reference to the zone name where the water equipment will be considered as latent load to the zone.
Field: Sensible Fraction Schedule Name
Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible sensible heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.
Field: Latent Fraction Schedule Name
Reference to the schedule object specifying the fraction of the maximum possible latent heat gain (based on inlet water conditions and ambient zone conditions) that is added to the zone. If blank, the schedule defaults to 0 at all times.

WaterUse:Storage
TheWaterUse:Storageobject is a central component for complex water systems. This object is not needed if the only use of water is directly from the mains, or utility service water. If the building model is to include any on-site collection or wells or storing and reuse of graywater, then aWaterUse:Storageis needed. EachWaterUse:Storagecan serve as a central node and make connections to numerous sources of supply or numerous components with demand. If a maximum capacity is not specified, the tank is assumed to have unlimited capacity. This is useful for sizing.
Storage tanks may handle a lot of water but show no use. This is because water usage is metered at the component level were water is used up. The only water a storage tank might use up is overflow water if it is discarded.

WaterUse:RainCollector
TheWaterUse:RainCollectorobject is used for harvesting rainwater falling on building surfaces. The rainwater is sent to aWaterUse:Storageobject. Up till version 9.6, in order to use this object, it is necessary to also include aSite:Precipitationobject to describe the rates of rainfall. For newer versions, if theSite:Precipitationobject is not defined, precipitation depth in the weather input .epw will be used instead. When this is the case, a warning message will be displayed. Please make sure the precipitation in the .epw is accurate. Thishttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records/all/maxpcould be a reference for sanity check of extreme values in the precipitation data. The tabular report “Monthly Precipitation Summary” provides a monthly summary of rainfall in the weather file and the amount used in the rain collector calculation.
Inputs
Field: Name
The unique object name for reference by other objects.
Field: Storage Tank Name
A reference to aWaterUse:Storageobject where the rainwater will be collected and stored for later use.
Field: Loss Factor Mode
TheWaterUse:RainCollectormodel includes a loss factor that indicates the portion of incident rain that is not successfully collected. Two modes are available: Constant and Scheduled. Enter Constant in this field for the model to use a simple fixed loss factor defined in the next field. For versatility, the loss factor can follow a schedule by entering Scheduled in this field and then the name of a schedule in the second field below.
Field: Collection Loss Factor
Constant loss factor for how much of the incident rainwater is lost and not collected. The factor should be between 0 and 1.
Field: Collection Loss Factor Schedule Name
Name of a schedule that defines a variable collection loss factor if the mode is selected as Scheduled.
Field: Maximum Collection Rate
The maximum flow rate [m3/s] for rainwater collection. In a scenario where a heavy rain fall is being harvested, the actual reclamation rate might be limited by pipe size or the filtration system.
Field: Collection Surface 1-10 Name
A reference to the name of a surface object which will collect the rain. Typically the collection surfaces would correspond to roof surfaces on the building. The effective area for rainwater collection is the horizontal component (areacosine of the slope, etc.). More detailed modeling of rainwater collection can be added later to account for factors such as wind speed and direction, etc.

WaterUse:Well
TheWaterUse:Wellobject is for simulating on-site water supply from a well. Well water is pumped out of the ground and into aWaterUse:Storage.The operation of the ground water well is controlled by the associatedWaterUse:Storagewhich is assumed to be operated as a vented cistern with no pressure tank. The current implementation is very simple and only requires two numeric inputs: the rated pump flow and power. A more elaborate well model may be added and many input fields are reserved for this future expansion.
