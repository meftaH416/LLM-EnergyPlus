Group - Fans
As of version 8.7, a new simple“Fan:SystemModel”input object was added that can be substitued forFan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,Fan:VariableVolume,andFanPerformance:NightVentilation.Users are encouraged to migrate their models to use this new Fan in the air loop or zone equipment because the original fan objects may be deprecated and eventually removed in the future.
The following fans may be defined either in the air loop or as a zone equipment component:Fan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,Fan:VariableVolume,Fan:ZoneExhaust,andFanPerformance:NightVentilation.The data that are common to these fan types include an identifying name, an availability schedule name, a total efficiency rating, a rated pressure rise, and inlet and outlet air node names. In the case of a variable volume fan, additional input includes parameters for modeling fan performance over a range of fan speeds. See the engineering documentation for the variable speed fan for a further description of what these coefficients represent. Commonly-used values for different variable volume systems are shown in the following table.
Fan:SystemModel
This object models fans of various types using a relatively simple engineering model. This fan can be used in variable air volume, constant volume, on-off cycling, two-speed, or multi-speed applications. It was designed as a replacement forFan:ConstantVolume,Fan:OnOff,Fan:VariableVolume,andFanPerformance:NightVentilation.The electric power consumed by the fan can be directly input or autosized using one of three optional methods. For fans that can vary the volume flow rate the performance can be described using a separate performance curve or table object. Or for fans with discrete speed control the power fraction at each speed can be input directly with no need for a performance curve.
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique name for this fan. Any reference to this fan by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of an availability schedule for this fan. Schedule values greater than zero means the fan is available. If this field is blank, the fan is always available.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
The name of an air system node at the inlet to the fan. This field is required.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
The name of an air system node at the outlet of the fan. This field is required.
Field: Design Maximum Air Flow Rate
This numeric field is the design volume flow rate of fan as installed in the HVAC system, in m/s. This volume flow rate will be converted to a mass flow rate using an altitude-adjusted standard density of dry air at 20 °C drybulb. This the full-speed flow rate and serves as the upper limit for fans that can vary their flow rate. This field can be autosized.
Field: Speed Control Method
This field is used to select how the fan speed can be varied. There are two choices, Continuous or Discrete. Discrete indicates that the fan can operate only at specific speed settings and cannot be continuously varied. Continuous indicates that the fan speed is variable and can change smoothly up to the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This input informs the program how power should be calculated with Discrete control using time-weighted averaging and Variable using flow-weighted averaging. A constant volume or on-off fan should use Discrete with Number of Speeds set to 1. A variable air volume fan should use Continuous. Continuous requires that a fan performance curve be entered in the input field called Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name.
Field: Electric Power Minimum Flow Rate Fraction
This numeric field is used to describe how low a variable speed fan can be operated. This value is used to calculate the fan power at low flow rates but does not enforce a lower end of the air flow during simulation. The value is a fraction of Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and should be between 0 and 1. This field is only used when Speed Control Method is set to Continuous.
Field: Design Pressure Rise
This numeric field is the total system pressure rise experienced by the fan in Pascals at full flow rate and altitude-adjusted standard density of dry air at 20 degrees Celsius drybulb. This field is required.
Field: Motor Efficiency
This numeric field describes the electric motor that drives the fan. Efficiency is the shaft power divided by the electric power consumed by the motor. The value must be between 0 and 1. The default is 0.9.
Field: Motor In Air Stream Fraction
This numeric field is the fraction of the motor heat that is added to the air stream. The value must be between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means fan motor is located completely outside of air stream and none of the motor's heat is added to the air stream. A value of 1.0 means the motor is located completely inside of air stream and all of the motor's heat is added to the air stream. Note that regardless of the value here there will be heat added to the air stream as a result of the work done to move the air, this field is only describing what happens to the heat generated as a result of the motor's inefficiency. The heat lost from the motor that is not added to the air stream can be added to the surrounding thermal zone where the motor is located by entering a zone name in the input field called Motor LossZoneName below.
Field: Design Electric Power Consumption
This numeric field is the electric power consumption at the full Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and Design Pressure Rise, in Watts. The value entered in this field is used to determine the fan efficiency. This field is autosizable and defaults to autosize. When autosized there are three different options available for the method used to size the design power and can be selected in the following field.
Field: Design Power Sizing Method
This field is used to select how the fan's Design Electric Power Consumption is sized when the previous field is set to autosize. There are three choices: PowerPerFlow, PowerPerFlowPerPressure, or TotalEfficiencyAndPressure. The default is PowerPerFlowPerPressure. When PowerPerFlow is selected, the value entered in the input field called Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate is used to size the Design Electric Power Consumption. This method is useful during early-phase design modeling when little information is available for determining the Design Pressure Rise. Although the pressure rise is not used to size the Design Electric Power Consumption it is still used to determine the heat added to the air stream as a result of the work done by the fan.
When PowerPerFlowPerPressure is selected, the value entered in the input field called Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure is used to size the power. This method takes into account the Design Pressure Rise when sizing the Design Electric Power Consumption. When TotalEfficiencyAndPressure is selected, the values entered in the input fields called Fan Total Efficiency and Design Pressure Rise are used to size the power. This is the legacy method used by the older fan objects prior to verson 8.6.
Field: Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlow and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value, in W/(m3/s), is used to scale the Design Electric Power Consumption directly from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This scaling factor is defined such that Design Electric Power Consumption = (Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate) * (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate).
Field: Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to PowerPerFlowPerPressure and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value, in W/((m3/s)-Pa), is used to scale the Design Electric Power Consumption from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and the Design Pressure Rise. This scaling factor is defined such that Design Electric Power Consumption = (Electric Power Per Unit Flow Rate Per Unit Pressure) * (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate) * (Design Pressure Rise). The default is 1.66667.
Field: Fan Total Efficiency
This numeric field is used when the Design Power Sizing Method is set to TotalEfficiency and the Design Electric Power Consumption is set to Autosize. This value is used to determine the Design Electric Power Consumption from the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate and the Design Pressure Rise. The total efficiency is defined such that the Design Electric Power Consumption = (Design Maximum Air Flow Rate) * (Design Pressure Rise) / (Fan Total Efficiency). The default is 0.7.
Field: Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name
This field is the name of performance curve or table that describes how electric power consumption varies with air flow rate. The independent “x” variable of the performance curve or look up table is a normalized flow fraction defined as the current flow rate divided by the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. The model actually uses the ratio of (moist) air mass flow rates with the numerator taking account of humidity and barometric pressure. The dependent variable that is the result of the performance curve or lookup table is a fraction that is multiplied by the Design Electric Power Consumption to determine the electric power use as a function of flow rate. Any of the single-independent-variable curves can be used. This field is required if the Speed Control Method is set to Continuous. This field is used when the Speed Control Method is set to Discrete and the Number of Speeds is greater than 1 and the input fields Speed “n” Electric Power Fraction are left blank. Note that the fourth order polynomial inCurve:Quarticcan be used with the coefficients listed above to replicate the formulation used in the olderFan:VariableVolumeinput object prior to version 8.6.
Field: Night Ventilation Mode Pressure Rise
This optional numeric field is the total system pressure rise experienced by the fan when operating in night mode usingAvailabilityManager:NightVentilation,in Pascals. This field allows modeling the fan device with a different system pressure that might occur when implementing a special strategy to precool a building at night using outdoor air with dampers fully open. This field is only used when anAvailabilityManager:NightVentilationobject is used that specifies the fan's availability schedule. This field and the next one replace theFanPerformance:NightVentilationobject which is not needed with this fan.
Field: Night Ventilation Mode Flow Fraction
This numeric field is the air flow fraction for the fan speed used when operating in night mode using AvailabilityManager:NighVentilation. This field corresponds to the input field called Maximum Flow Rate in theFanPerformance:NightVentilationobject and, as is the case there, this field is not currently used by the night ventilation manager (which has its own flow fraction field at present). This is a fraction between 0 and 1 and describes the speed level for the fan relative to the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate. This field and the previous one replace theFanPerformance:NightVentilationobject which is not needed with this fan.
Field: Motor Loss Zone Name
This optional field can be used to input the name of theZonein which the fan motor is located. If the fan is outdoors, or the motor's thermal losses are not to be modeled then leave this field blank. If a validZonename is entered then the portion of the motor's thermal losses that are not added to the air stream are added to the surrounding thermal zone as internal heat gains.
Field: Motor Loss Radiative Fraction
This optional numeric field is used when aZonename is entered in the previous field to determine the split between thermal radiation and thermal convection for the heat losses from the fan motor. If this field is left blank then all the losses will be convective. Values should be between 0 and 1.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
This optional field allows entering a user-defined name for the end use subcategory that will be used to meter this fan's electric energy consumption. If this field is omitted or left blank the fan will be assigned to the “General” end use subcategory. End use subcategories are helpful to organize reports in the tabular summary table and appear on special meter outputs. Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table.
Field: Number of Speeds
This numeric field is used to specify the number of different speed levels available when Speed Control Method is set to Discrete. This field and the remaining field sets are not used when the Speed Control Method is set to Continuous. For a constant volume fan enter a value of 1.0. A value of 1.0 will use the fan's maximum design and no additional field sets are needed. When set to a value greater than 1 then a pair of flow and power fraction inputs are provided for each speed in the remaining input fields.
Field Set: (Speed Flow Fraction, Speed Electric Power Fraction)
A field set is pair of values for the flow fraction and electric power fraction at each speed. The sets should be arranged in increasing order so that the flow fractions become larger in subsequent field sets. Typically the highest speed level will match the design maximum and have fractions of 1.0. This object is extensible, so additional sets of the following two fields can be added to the end of this object.
Field: Speed <#> Flow Fraction
This is the flow fraction for the fan speed. This value is multiplied by the Design Maximum Air Flow Rate to obtain the flow rate when operating at this speed.
Field: Speed <#> Electric Power Fraction
This field is the electric power fraction for the fan speed. This value is multiplied by the Design Electric Power Consumption to obtain the power consumption when operating at this speed. This field is optional if a performance curve is used in the input field Electric Power Function of Flow Fraction Curve Name. If omitted and the performance curve is entered, the power at this speed will be determined using the curve or table. If the power fraction is entered in this field it will be used instead of the curve or table. This allows either overriding the curve for particular speeds or removes the necessity of creating a curve for discrete speed control.

This object models a constant air volume fan that is intended to cycle on and off in tandem with a cooling or heating system (i.e., AUTO fan control mode). The fan can also operate continuously likeFan:ConstantVolume.If modeling continuous operation and this object is used as part of a system that utilizesCoil:Heating:Fuel,Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeedorCoil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed,the user should confirm proper air flow rates (coil and fan max flows are equal) and that the coil part-load fraction correlation(s) are appropriate (e.g., part-load fraction is less than or equal to 1 for all values of coil part-load ratio). If modeling multi-speed fan operation, this object must be used as part of a compound object that allows multiple fan speeds (e.g.,AirLoopHVAC:Unitary:Furnace:HeatCool,ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner,etc.).

Fan:ZoneExhaust
This fan object differs from the other fans in that it stands on its own in a zone rather than serving as one part of an HVAC air system. This object appears directly in aZoneHVAC:EquipmentListobject and all the controls are contained within the fan object. The zone exhaust fan model provides a way to include the electrical power used by the fan. It can also impact air flows in central air handlers by decreasing the flow of return air and sometimes increasing the outdoor air flow rate.
There are several control options available for the exhaust fan including: an on/off availability schedule, interaction with system availability managers, minimum zone air temperature control limits and a variable flow fraction schedule.
The way in which the exhaust fan impacts central air system can be controlled by declaring what portion of the flow has been balanced by simple airflow from infiltration, ventilation, or mixing. However, it is important to note that presence of an exhaust fan does not by itself drive any simple airflow such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing. For balancing, the simple airflows need to have their own input objects that need to be coordinated with the exhaust fan. TheZoneAirMassFlowConservationobject could be a possible solution that can help with balancing unbalanced airflows by triggering the zone air mass flow conservation when desired.
Inputs
Field: Name
A unique user-assigned name for an instance of aFan:ZoneExhaust.Any reference to this fan by another object will use this name.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the fan can run during a given time period. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the fan is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the fan can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Applicable availability managers (ref.AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList)may override this schedule by forcing the fan to be on or off.
Field: Fan Total Efficiency
This value is the overall efficiency of the fan, i.e., the ratio of the power delivered to the fluid to the electrical input power. It is the product of the motor efficiency and the impeller efficiency. The motor efficiency is the power delivered to the shaft divided by the electrical power input to the motor. The impeller efficiency is power delivered to the fluid (air) divided by the shaft power. The power delivered to the fluid is the mass flow rate of the air multiplied by the pressure rise divided by the air density. This input value must be between 0 and 1. The default is 0.6.
Field: Pressure Rise
The pressure rise in Pascals at full flow and standard (sea level) conditions (20 °C and 101325 Pa).
Field: Maximum Flow Rate
The full load air volumetric flow rate (m/sec) at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20 °C drybulb). The program does use local barometric pressure to account for altitude using equation for “standard atmospheric” pressure on p 6.1 of the ASHRAE 1997 HOF (SI edition) to initialize the air systems being simulated.
p = 101325*(1-2.25577E-05*Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
The name of the HVAC system node which supplies the inlet air conditions to the fan. This node should be listed as a zone exhaust node in an associatedZoneHVAC:EquipmentConnectionsobject.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
The name of the HVAC system node to which the fan sends its outlet air.
Field: End-Use Subcategory
Allows you to specify a user-defined end-use subcategory, e.g., “Kitchen Exhaust”, “Fume Hoods”, etc. A new meter for reporting is created for each unique subcategory (ref:Output:Meterobjects). Any text may be used here to categorize the end-uses in the ABUPS End Uses by Subcategory table and in the LEED Summary EAp2-4/5 Performance Rating Method Compliance table. If this field is omitted or blank, the fan will be assigned to the “General” end-use subcategory.
Field: Flow Fraction Schedule Name
This field is optional. If it is not used then the fan operates at the maximum flow rate. If a schedule is input here, then it should contain fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The flow rate that the fan operates will be this fraction times the maximum flow rate. This allows a variable speed exhaust fan to be modeled according to a schedule.
Field: System Availability Manager Coupling Mode
This field is optional. If it is not used then the exhaust fan is assumed to be integrated with the central air handler's system availability manager. This field can be used to control if the exhaust fan should operate independently or not. For example, when a night cycle availability manager turns on the central air system for freeze protection, this field can be used to control if the zone exhaust fans should also run at the same time or not. The key choice Coupled indicates that the exhaust fan should be integrated with the system availability manager so that the fan runs when the air system is forced to run. The key choice Decoupled indicates that the exhaust fan should operate on its own and ignore the system availability manager's requests so that the exhaust fan can remain off when the air system runs. The default is Coupled.
Field: Minimum Zone Temperature Limit Schedule Name
This field is optional. If it is not used then there will be no temperature-related control over the operation of the exhaust fan. If the field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with values for zone temperature values (°C). The fan's control will be based on a comparison between the current zone air temperature and the schedule values. If the zone is warmer than the scheduled limit, then the fan will operate. When balancing with simple ventilation, this feature can be used to coordinate exhaust fan operation with ZoneVentilation:* controls for minimum indoor temperature.
Field: Balanced Exhaust Fraction Schedule Name
This field is optional. If it is not used, then all the exhaust air flow is assumed to be unbalanced by any simple airflows, such as infiltration, ventilation, or zone mixing. Unbalanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by the outdoor air system in the central air system. The modeling of unbalanced will reduce the flow rates at the zone's return air node by the flow rate that is being exhausted and will ensure that the outdoor air flow rate is sufficient to serve the exhaust. If this field is used, then enter the name of a schedule with fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. This fraction is applied to the exhaust fan flow rate and the model tracks the portion of the exhaust that is balanced. Balanced exhaust is then modeled as being provided by simple airflows and does not impact the central air system return air or outdoor air flow rates. For example, if a kitchen zone with an exhaust fan is designed to draw half of its make up air from a neighboring dining room and the other half from the outdoor air system, then a schedule value of 0.5 could be used here. This input field must be blank when the zone air flow balance is enforced. If user specifies a schedule and zone air flow balance is enforced, then EnergyPlus throws a warning error message, ignores the schedule and simulation continues.

Fan:ComponentModel
TheFan:ComponentModelfan is a more detailed fan type that can be defined in the air loop for central constant-air-volume (CAV) and variable-air-volume (VAV) systems. It includes inputs that describe the air-distribution system as well as the fan, its drive belt (if used), its motor, and its variable-frequency-drive (if used). See the engineering documentation for further descriptions about the inputs for this fan type.
Inputs
Field: Name
The required unique user-assigned alpha name for an instance of aFan:ComponentModel.Any reference to this fan by another object will use this name.
Field: Air Inlet Node Name
The required alpha name of the HVAC system node which supplies the inlet air conditions to the fan.
Field: Air Outlet Node Name
The required alpha name of the HVAC system node to which the fan sends its outlet air.
Field: Availability Schedule Name
The required alpha name of the schedule (ref: Schedule) that denotes whether the fan can run during a given time period. A schedule value of 0 indicates that the fan is off for that time period. A schedule value greater than 0 indicates that the fan can operate during the time period. If this field is blank, the schedule has values of 1 for all time periods. Applicable availability managers (ref.AvailabilityManagerAssignmentList)may override this schedule by forcing the fan to be on or off.
Field: Maximum Flow Rate
The full-load volumetric airflow (m/sec) through the fan at standard temperature and pressure (dry air at 20 °C dry-bulb). To initialize the air systems being simulated, the program uses local barometric pressure adjusted for altitude, based on the equation for “standard atmospheric” pressure on p.6.1 of the 1997 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (SI edition):
p = 101325 * (1 - 2.25577E-05 * Z)**5.2559
where p = pressure in Pa and Z = altitude in m. Can be autosized.
Specified or autosized maximum airflow rate (including effects of scaling by Field: Fan Sizing Factor) along with corresponding fan static pressure rise and fan shaft power are reported in the .eio file as, respectively, Design Fan Airflow [m3/s], Design Fan Static Pressure Rise [Pa], and Design Fan Shaft Power [W].
Field: Minimum Flow Rate
The minimum volumetric airflow (m/sec) through the fan at standard temperature and pressure (see Maximum Flow Rate field above for condition details). Can be autosized.
Field: Fan Sizing Factor
The numeric dimensionless factor (F) used to multiply the specified or autosized full-load volumetric airflow (see Maximum Flow Rate field above for details) for fan sizing. If specified, minimum value is 1.0. Default is 1.0 if field is blank.
Field: Fan Wheel Diameter
The required numeric outer diameter of the fan wheel (D, m). This value is determined from manufacturer's data. In general, larger diameter fans have higher maximum efficiency than smaller diameter fans of the same type (Ref: AMCA Standard 205-10: Energy Efficiency Classification for Fans). Must be greater than zero.
Field: Fan Outlet Area
The required numeric outlet area of the fan (A, m). This value is determined from manufacturer's data. It is used to convert fan total pressure rise to fan static pressure rise. Fan static pressure rise is the fan total pressure rise minus the fan outlet velocity pressure; it is not the difference between fan outlet and inlet static pressures (Ref: ANSI/AMCA Standard 210-07, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 51-07: Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Certified Aerodynamic Performance Rating). Must be greater than zero.
Field: Maximum Fan Static Efficiency
The required numeric maximum ratio () between the power delivered to the air (H, W) and the fan shaft input power (H, W).
